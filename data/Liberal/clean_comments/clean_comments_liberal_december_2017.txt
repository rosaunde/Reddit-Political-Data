Many right-sided media outlets shove the point that more is needed because of x threat or y threat.

Under our current system, these voters are disenfranchised due to the boundaries on a map. The diffusion of these voters throughout the state prevents reasonable geographic boundaries from being established around them, thus denying them the level of representation their numbers warrant. \n\nWhat we need to do is replace the idea of congressional districts with actual, proportional representation. Each state keeps the same number of seats in their congressional delegation, but all of those seats are filled in state-wide, proportional elections instead of district, plurality elections. \n\nWe could further balance the candidates by weighting their votes proportionate to the number of people they represent. The 435 delegates to the House of Representatives would cast 309,300,000 votes, one for each person in the US at the time of the last census. The Wyoming delegate would cast 564,460 of those votes.

You can marginalize a minority group, and that's bad right? Is it not also bad to marginalize a majority?\n\nThere are solutions, in my opinion, but they don't involve drawing better lines. They involve making the specific lines drawn have less impact on who is represented and by whom, and they generally fall under the heading of \"proportional representation.\"\n\nA geographically concentrated constituency of 700,000 people can easily dominate one congressional district (that seems pretty fair at a glance), or two congressional districts (that seems less fair), or none (that also doesn't seem fair), depending on how the lines are drawn.

{"author":"Tipsyfishes","body":"1.) Look at the time-frame. When Obama was entering in office the nation was going through a recession. I'm uncertain that the Bush administration could have really stopped it, let alone Obama. More jobs have been created since Trump has been president but it has been under the Obama budget and still is. The government shutdown that is being talked about on Dec. 8th is in response to not having a budget in place created during this year. Obama's late 2016-2017 budget was extended in September as part of the hurricane relief effort. \n\n2.) If someone is in violation of the Constitution then they are in violation of it. Skimming over the details that \"only some of what he did was in violation\" means nothing. If you are to adhere past and future people to those same rule sets, you shouldn't allow someone to not face consequences from that rule set.\n\n3.) Their's a big difference between \"political correctness\" and being rude to people. Trump is rude to many people, plain and simple. A company would not allow an employee to speak like he does towards customers and it should be even more strict regarding a president.  He's supposed to be the face of the nation after all.\n\n4.) That's a very broad and general biased understanding. Liberals as a whole don't go and riot, you have a section of people that do it regardless as to where they are, or who is having a rally and they are generally not liked by many on the left. Conservatives, and moderates have these people too. \n\n5.) To quote Senator hatch from Utah regarding Child healthcare \u201cI have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won\u2019t help themselves, won\u2019t lift a finger and expect the federal government to do everything.\u201d He said this about CHILD HEALTHCARE. \n\nGoing on the \"take responsibility\" tangent is just a cop out of the actual situation. Do you think that many people can pay an additional 4-7k in taxes a year if they make 30-50k a year? The idea that you can just find a better paying job is not realistic anymore and you have a structure that says that college is needed to reach these higher paying jobs. Many people live pay check to paycheck. Hell, my family lived pay check to pay check and we own a business that is doing very well compared to many others operating in the same field.  \n\nPeople in social benefits program need to be working to actually be able to apply into these programs. It's not people being lazy and not wanting to work, that's not how social programs work at all. Do you have some that are like that? Yes, but they are a very small minority. The thing is that many conservatives that call for a reduction in social programs are the ones receiving these welfare benefits in the first place. I believe (and of course could be mistaken) is that they understand how vulnerable of a position that they are in on that system and want to remove people where possible. It's all about a consolidation of control, by parting out these groups, or this group, they believe that it would create a bigger safety net for themselves.\n\nIf someone is disabled, mentally or physically un-able to work, lost their job, recovering from a medical problem etc. Then they should be helped. Would you say \"you're just being lazy\" to a family member that just had an expensive surgery, or say that to a family member who had severe mental issues and couldn't live on their own/work because of it? No, I doubt you would.\n\n6.) Let's look at Healthcare for a moment. Now, I do not know every in and out of why the USA pays more for less in regards to healthcare but there are several contributing factors:\n\nFirst and foremost is insurance companies. In general you pay for insurance, insurance pays your medical bills. Hospitals/Doctors want the bills to be as high as possible (as they make more money). Insurance on the other hand wants them to be as low as possible (so they pay less money). Insurance companies hold a lot of power over how much they will charge since they have a lot of customers and can bargain effectively.\n\nHowever, the motivations are not quite a clear as above. The insurance company wants to make as much money as possible but the hospital has to get paid at least a minimum amount to keep the lights on. Since hospitals have to treat everyone they have to raise prices on those with insurance so those without insurance can still get covered when they go to the ER. This means insurance companies have to charge their customers a bit more to cover that... plus the overhead of running their very large organization (salespeople, actuaries, CEO's delivery people, some doctors etc). This also gets charged through to their customer as an insurance premium so insurance is just a bit higher to cover those costs. Then insurance companies want to make more profit and since we are talking about health care they basically have a pretty captive market so they turn up the prices enough to make profit.\n\nSo the insurance company has become a really large bureaucratic middle man that bargains with individual hospitals, sets prices, deals with customers and tries to get their cut of all the money. Billing is now VERY complicated since insurance company A pays $10 for procedure A while another insurance company bargained a different rate and pays $15. Hospitals now have to employ literally hundreds of people to manage the billing process. The insurance company hires a bunch to do it as well and the insurance rates are higher.\n\nNow, take a regulated single payer system. Hospitals do not have to hire 200 people to do billing since it is straight forward and there is 1 payment processor. Instead they hire 3 and the salaries of 197 people go towards health care, paying doctors, buying equipment and everything else. The entire insurance company that is supported by medical bills no longer has to exist and the billions of dollars that go to supporting that industry can go towards health care and healthcare is not only better but also cheaper.\n\nFor example: When dealing with pharmaceutical companies, the British NHS, which represents ~60 million people and is far and away the biggest player in the UK healthcare market, has a much better negotiating position than anyone representing a smaller number/percentage of Americans.\n\nIf we take the UK, they spend around $2,800 per capita on healthcare (this includes diagnosis, treatment, and pharmaceuticals). That's to cover literally every man, woman and child in the country. For the sake of rounding, let's say $3,000 per person.\n\n$3,000 x 323,100,000 people (US population) = $969,300,000,000\nSo based on the UK model, the US could provide universal healthcare for just under $1 trillion per year. The US already spends nearly $1.2 trillion just through Medicare and Medicaid for a very small percentage of the population. So you're actually saving money on healthcare spending right off the bat.\n\nWould single payer solve the healthcare problem on it's own? No. But it's a step in the right direction. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.","created_utc":1512426920,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Using a confidence interval expresses that you are 95% confident (for example) that the true value of the parameter you are testing for lies within that interval within your overall dataset. It has nothing to do with removing variables. \n\nThe scientific method is not meant to remove variables. The scientific method can be used to understand and describe the influence one or more variables has on a parameter. You might be thinking of a regression, a statistical process to understand the extent to which independent variable(s) have on a dependent variable - insignificant variables can be removed in the analysis to produce a more accurate regression result. \n\n&gt;I'm fairly certain that Ben uses the black crime statistic to propose that black rates of criminality are more so due to a cultural issue than an institutional one.

In this case, black rates of criminality are due to a cultural issue - and why is that? What are the cultural issues - like single parent households - and why are they caused? This is where he falls short. I don't really want to dive into the reasons why black households tend to be single parent households right now, but if Ben Shapiro addresses that in his book, I'd be happy to read it - just like I suggested to my cousin. He may not outwardly say \"blacks are criminals because they are black\" but if he leaves the argument as \"blacks are criminals because of black culture\", it's basically saying the same thing.

But, because I\u2019m not down there, I\u2019m not seeing how well his rhetoric is appealing to his potential constituents.\n\nAt the end of the day, regardless of what Moore has done, I\u2019m betting things go like this: 1) Moore wins election. 2) ethics committee begins investigation. 3) GOP uses Moore for his Yes vote on the tax bill. 4) ethics committee concludes investigation, recommends Moore\u2019s resignation. 5) Moore resigns. 6) Finally, the GOP appoints another (R) senator, similar to what is happening with Al Franken.\n\nEdit: Turns out step 6 is not allowed as AL is not one of the states that allows governors to appoint senators, and instead requires special elections. So steps 4-6 are kinda... iffy.","created_utc":1512948424,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I've been told my life doesn't matter. I've been told that the world would be better off if my race didn't exist. And more. All of those things were said to my face. So saying White's aren't discriminated against is objectively false. Hell, the fact that this it's okay to be white thing blew up is proof of that. Barely anyone would care if you switch white with black, but since it's white, people freaked the fuck out. How is that not proof some people have a problem with white people? I'm not saying white people are as discriminated against as black people or even other races. I'm just saying discrimination against whites exist. That's a fact. \n\nMy point is this... We live in politically tense times. There's people who hate white people, black people, brown people, Asians, you name it. Yes white people are privileged, but so are other races. It just depends on how you determine privilege. Do you determine it based on the average amount of money one race earns? That goes to Asians. Do you determine it based on what race is the majority and therefore has the most power. That goes to whites. Do you determine it by who gets the least amount of racial discrimination? Well, I honestly don't know who wins that, and I honestly doubt you do, because nobody really does. There are other ways you can check privilege like \"Who gets the most government support\" and whatnot, but you get the idea. \n\nLook, I disagree with you and you probably disagree with me, but that's fine, people do that. However, I'm always a person who is open to new opinions and I'd be willing to chat about political stuff like this in DM's. I think you have some \"interesting\" ideas, and you probably think the same about me.

{"author":"Clads","body":"I like the side to side comparison of both arguments. I think it's best to look at the following ways. We can either start from a position of skepticism and say there's no proof or evidence made by the women, or at the very least, words are not enough to pass judgment. This can get tricky because there are dubious pictures of Franken where one can make the argument that those pictures are proof.  And of course, Moore being banned from the mall etc. If there's better \"proof\" that you know of you can just replace that with what I stated in my argument. This is also a good argument because then you can look at each case individually based off the evidence. On the other hand one can state that \"there are a lot of women so it must be true\" then we have a problem because then that indicts both Moore and Franken on equal terms where we would expect both to bow out. A lot of it comes down to what is actually considered \"evidence.\" The \"Franken did far less than Moore so he shouldn't quit\" is faulty because each case needs to be judged independently of one another where we can say that, yes Moore did something worse than Franken, yet that doesn't mean Franken's punishment should have been any less warranted.  I'm curious to know what people consider \"evidence\" for both cases. If we say that Moore should drop out based off physical evidence, and not just words or statement, then we have to look at all the evidence, not statements or words, considered against Franken.

Normally probably not, but in this environment even the appearance of hypocrisy is poison to the #metoo movement.  Franken's loss is a high price to pay, and it even illustrates the danger of weaponized assault accusations (see the prelude to the [Tulsa race riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot) for one of many examples), but the importance of forcing culture to square with the perpetual peril fully half the population faces is not an opportunity we can afford let pass.  It's not fair, but it is the situation we are in.\n\nThe other point to consider is there is no good outcome for Franken here.  When the day comes that we have faith in the legal and ethical institutions that adjudicate these claims, then a pass on Franken's so called 'boorish' behavior would have legitimacy.  Today is not that day. Today, any outcome of an ethics investigation would be punishing.

{"author":"VOLDAMERICA","body":"| Trump can fire Mueller\n\nYes, he can. But if he does it will only make him look more guilty and risks turning moderate Republicans against him.\n\n| Presidential pardon.\n\nHe can also do this, but there are multiple problems here. First is this only further risks alienating moderate Republicans. Also in order to accept a pardon Flynn (or anyone else brought up on charges) has to plead guilty. This will only further damage the administration.\n\n| Republican Congress\n\nWhile there are definitely Trump allies in Congress, he still has enemies in his own Party (McCain, Flake, and Corker just to name a few). Also if Trump tried any of the above and the GOP allowed it to happen, they would all be vulnerable in the next election. The balance of power could easily swing back to Dems in the House and Senate by 2018 or 2020 if Trump becomes too authoritarian and Congress does nothing to stop him.\n\n| Packed courts.\n\nNot really sure how this is an issue. Impeachment proceedings don't go through regular courts, and any interference by the administration in court proceedings against former or current administration officials is obstruction of justice.\n\n| Friends in high places.\n\nDonors are only really helpful in the next election. Donors can help build a big machine, but you have to weigh that against the fundraising power of people across the socioeconomic spectrum resisting a authoritarian President). Also if Trump goes to far it's not inconceivable that parts of the GOP megadonor base move their support to a less toxic candidate in the primary (if someone decides to run). While a primary run isn't guaranteed, it becomes much more likely the more authoritarian Trump appears.\n\n| Friends in low places.\n\nThe MAGA crowd is at best 30-40% of the country. That's not enough to keep him in power. The worse things get, the more Fox will appear to be state-sponsored media. This will only turn off more of this crowd. While parts of the MAGA crowd are diehard supporters, a good chunk supported Trump and his ideology because they felt left behind from the 2008 recovery and live in areas that are still facing economic hardships. Trump will have to deliver economic wins for this crowd to keep their support from crumbling. He's already been largely ineffective in passing his legislative agenda, and I don't see this changing. Tax cuts passed because most of the GOP Congress (even his outspoken critics) have been running on that for years and promised those cuts to their donor base. Furthermore the tax cuts will likely significantly hurt the. MAGA crowd (even if it takes years before they notice).\n\nA Trump impeachment won't come easily, I'll grant you that. Unless the Mueller investigation finds a smoking gun (which is probably unlikely) it's much more likely that Trump looses in the 2020 election. Before that it's also equally possible that Democrats are able to take control of both houses as Trump becomes more authoritarian and start impeachment proceedings based on anything that Mueller digs up. Remember that Clinton was \"impeached\" (though not convicted) for simply lying about his affair. Trump has already committed crimes rising to around that level, and the more authoritarian he gets the more \"high crimes\" he is likely to commit. Firing Mueller would make a solid case for obstruction. When Nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating him it was the beginning of the end for his Presidency.

This is a complex question, but I think people know very well what Hillary Clinton was doing for a side gig: speaking to big banks who were lobbying to deregulate the financial industry, which lead to the housing bubble in the first place, not to mention the entire collapse afterwards which made people lose trust in institutions.\n\nIt's easy to sit back and look at statistics that say a population should just do something because a certain variable is supposed to be optimized, but as we've known for a long time, people are not homo economicus. We tend to look at short term signals, and the short-term signals clearly seem to say that Democrats were/are the worse option to the Republicans. Long-term, it's muddy; we can go there, but I don't think it's as relevant for analyzing behavior.\n\nNow, I would like to see stats for the income per capita, per quantile of various nations. However, I'd like to see that in dollars, not in percent of GDP. To a degree, I side with Milton Friedman that said inequality wasn't what you should be concerned about; it should be the real $ gains or losses for the lower percentiles of the population. On the flipside, I can see the danger in a population that is extremely unequal even if the poor are wealthy, since $ indirectly translates into social and political capital, and those matter too. Like any statistic, there are pros and cons. I looked hard for this, and I couldn't find it.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThat's the economic discussion. Like I said though, people didn't vote in the current president on economic principles, at least not directly. Research showed it was heavily racial. When I said \"culture of the race, not the race itself\" earlier, I shouldn't have. Those two things are essentially the same; race isn't taken solely to be the color of skin or other genetic markers. \n\nWhat I should have said is that the racial sentiment was not outwards; it was inwards. It wasn't a decision to, say, cut off a particular race from any government service. It was a fear that one's own race's culture's main values were being lost in the sea of equality/multiculturalism. I think white centrist people essentially said: the Democrats are not looking out for us; we will go to the Republicans who will look out for us. \n\nIs it identity politics? I'm sure it was part of it. However, I don't think the centrists were anti-gays, blacks, women, etc. I think they saw the huge wave of identity politics, and they were never even mentioned. I can't name a lot of cultures values or practices off the top of my head that I think white centrists felt were being lost. It's a little bit here, a little bit there. Some of the ideas surely have overlap. I bet there are good papers out there that talk about this, and I'd love to discuss this further.\n\nHowever, I will highlight one *key* cultural component of the white centrists that has probably left everyone *furious*: the dying of marriage. As I mentioned earlier, I think the Democrats have been lead by upper middle class feelings lately, and the upper middle is more okay with marriage issues. They're wealthier, so it's not as much of an economic need. They're more self-actualized, so there is less reliance on marriage for fulfillment. They're more educated, so they might even logically look at marriage as just a silly old custom. On the other hand, middle class people use marriage as their bedrock for everything. \n\nIt's not any one thing that Democrats have done to disrupt marriage. You might be thinking about gay marriage right now, but those are just warm and fuzzies. How about the fact that [marriage and divorce rates have plummeted](http://www.stateofourunions.org/2011/images/fig-si-01.png)? Men surely look at how family courts have ripped their kids away in divorces and awarded monetary compensations to the wives. Surely they look at the federal government that gives grants to single mothers, which in their minds is enabling this behavior. [Married people are having less sex now.](http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/graph1.jpg) Surely they look at movies, magazines, and the internet, and they see the temptations. They don't see any government programs that attempt to help marriages; they just see help for people that want to leave marriages or form alternative marriages.\n\nI don't want to narrow this down to white middle class centrist males, but the angry white male did prove to be a strong constituent in recent elections. Many of the aforementioned marriage issues equally affect women. The issue is not 'why can't homosexual/unicorn-sexual people get married?' It's 'why can't anyone get married and stay married?' The Republicans are less the 'law and order' party and more the 'family values' party at this point, I believe. This is why they captured the victory. The centrists and the middle class people value their family (+ their culture, which is an extension of the family), and that is how they voted.","created_utc":1513601516,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I would actually like to see *more* percentiles listed, but I understand how that could make it harder to read. [Here's one with a very nice, long date range.](https://02varvara.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/01-us-income-distribution-1947-2007.jpg)\n\n[This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom#/media/File:UK_income_percentiles.svg) covers the past 20 years in the UK and has a few more percentiles listed.

[Here's one chart](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2.png) though that touches on several countries, except with only two date markers for comparison (1994 and 2007). [This University of Oxford blog says:](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/10/inequality/)\n\n&gt; This suggest the change in US inequality is a product of the US rich being richer than before (and being richer than the rich in Welfare States) and the poorer remaining mostly the same as before (and about the same as the poor in Welfare States). \n\n\nThat right there is the smoking gun for me. When people talk about inequality, they aren't usually talking about what the poor have. They're talking about what the rich have. So, it seems that in either case, the lower quantiles of the population saw little to no income gain. In some countries, the upper quantiles saw more gain, and in others, they saw little to no gain. The countries that saw gain in wealth also saw gains in inequality, but it was not because the poor were worse off. The most you could say is that the poorer quantiles have less social and political capital in said scenarios, but to be honest, that's a complex argument and should not be reduced to numbers like this.","created_utc":1513608267,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"jack_alexander","body":"I feel for you. I'm a 68-year-old very liberal (almost completely socialist actually). I'm seriously worried what is going to happen to educated persons like yourself (and myself). I know a quote that you might find useful when you talk to a repug: When you argue with an idiot they drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. I am quoting Mark Twain aka Samuel Clemens. He was alive from 1835 to 1910. When you encounter what I will call an idiot, just walk away. They are not going to learn anything new. They are either too stupid or lazy between the ears.\n\nWe are living in a time where we are at a point of having a dictatorship. Aldous Huxley (1931) said this: The perfect dictatorship would have the appearance of a democracy, but would be a prison without walls in which the prisoners would not even dream of escaping. It would essentially be a system of slavery where, through consumption and entertainment, the slaves would love their servitude.\n\nThis should help you understand the conservative thought of today. They are just lazy, stupified, between the ears or are in denial of the truth out of fear. If they were to take a serious look at their situation they would likely implode mentally.\n\nAmerica, stolen from the natives is a nation of thieves and has been,  since the country as we call it formed. Since the end of the great depression, created by the wealthy we have become a warfare nation, yet most like your mother don't believe it.\n\nWe make war to make the wealthy wealthier. I fear that tRump will eventually, if we are not lucky enough to remove him, will get us involved in some kind of war or a world war. In fact, a world war would be even better for the wealthy since it would reduce the population and make it easier for them to make virtual slaves of the surviving populace and increase their power and wealth. I fear this may come true due to the, well, idiots we are surrounded with. \n\nPersonally I hope that I die before then, but certainly, worry for those younger than me and such a bleak future.\n\nMy recommendation is to continue to educate yourself so that you will be intelligent enough to prevent this possibility. You and the other younger people of today must find a way to civilize not only this country and the world, but also engender the thought that this can be done with lots of work. Teach others what you know. If it is an idiot in front of you, walk away, for they are lost.\n\nThe U.S. is not a Xtian nation, in fact it is far from it. Religion is a tool of those who teach ignorance so that people can be controlled. It is very important to resist this. And example of this ignorance is the Vatican and what it teaches. So many people under the thumb of what amounts to a privileged billionaire who teaches a fairy tale. I could include the Muslims here as well. So many people, so ignorant that they broadcast video of a child sawing the head off of an 'infedel' in the name of Islam. Religion is such a waste.\n\nThere are many people that you should listen to. If you can get your hands on some (or all, as I have) of what George Carlin had to say in his final years. He was a genius with words and ideas. Had John Lennon lived longer we would have been taught more about peace and being educated.\n\nMy rule of my life is: Question Everything--all of the time.\n\nThere is so much I could write here, but I don't want to write a book for you. But know this: With your computer you have the whole planet at your hands. Make friends with those who are like you no matter where they are. Use the knowlege that is available here. And live a free and informed life my friend. Today: RESIST! Resist ignorance and slavery.\n\nAnd please, try to enjoy your life knowing what is right and what is very wrong....We are a people,not a race or races, and geo-political borders are unnecessary. We are those who have one planet and we must try to make it better for all people or we will extinguish ourselves.\n\nThank you for reading this and good luck in your life. With regards....Jack E.

No amount of logic or reasoning is going to change my parents' views on things, and the same can be said about many of those who vote Republican (and probably liberals too).

As is the case for many, my worldview was quite shattered after the election -- I had been overestimating our populace by quite a bit apparently, and I'm still working to reconcile this. I still want to push our society forward and invest more heavily in education, technology, climate, healthcare, etc... \n\nI think honestly we actually just need to refocus our efforts on the state, or even better, the city-level of government. I'm trying more and more to focus on those levels of government (which is a slightly conservative idea), and ideally a stronger coalition between cities to enact change. It at least helps to work as a coping mechanism and I find a bit of hope there -- which I definitely need after hearing my parents talk about this latest tax bill where I literally wanted to slam my head into the nearest wall.","created_utc":1513750662,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I've got an answer, though the non-misanthropic amongst us may not enjoy it.\n\nThe very definition of \"conservative\" is someone who believes that the established order should be upheld.  It does get a little more complex: when liberals have been in power and changed things, naturally the conservatives want change too -- they want to change things back.  MAGA!\n\nBut why do people ever retire?  Some apparently believe that their job was done, and done well: they're retiring in their old age because they got the entire world fixed up perfect, and you young people just need to keep it in the current state (i.e. be conservatives).  In their minds, they're like boxers who retire in glory undefeated, nothing left to do, no worlds left to conquer.\n\nAt the age of 57, I beg to differ.  Apparently, unlike most people, I've been actually getting fatter, dumber, slower, uglier, weaker, and even less sexually potent as I age.  I'm retiring because I can't really do my job well anymore: I have to trust in the young people to pick up where I left off, to continue the endless struggle to make the world a better place.

Now, I feel like liberal might be too right wing of label for me so maybe I can help.\n\nTry to keep it simple.  With people I don\u2019t know that well I use simple questions like \n\n&gt;\u201cWhen has our current GOP government sided with workers over billionaire and big business?\u201d  \n\nThe GOP is so bad they can't answer.  This question establishes a conflict and frames it as we are both on the same side.\n\nWith your mom though you should probably get into her values and develop a frame that resonates with those values.  \n\nSo ask:\n\n* What's good about what's going on in the country\n* Where do you hope the country is going.\n* What's bad about what's going on in the country.\n* Where do you fear the country is going.\n\nUse the values she uses.  Like if she fears that liberals make the government too big and that will end in a dictatorship, obvious freedom, liberty and independence are important to her.  If it\u2019s something else like justice or something get to those values.\n\nThis is important, you can have all the facts and a logically sound argument, but if the values you are using are inequality and my politics is based off freedom and liberty that won\u2019t resonate with me. \n\nKnowing her values you can begin to show that liberals and her are on the same side. Build class solidarity, like your and liberal values are the same as hers.  You value freedom and liberty, you want everybody to be able to have a meaningful life.  \n\nNext you need to get to the situation we are in, this is called class consciousness.  She may have all these weird concerns like some college campus in the middle of nowhere has some weird policy.  Maybe she's worried that some guy will marry a dog and want a cake that a baker will have to make.  It\u2019s not an accident she has them, this is what right wing media does on purpose.  It\u2019s called false consciousness.  It\u2019s stuff in the way to obscure and prevent her from focusing on her current situation.

One side wants to set up society so that power is distributed more equally among Americans the other wants to concentrate that power into an elite few.

Is freedom merely a privilege unless it's enjoyed by one and all?\"\n\nAs far as conspiracy theories, I have had some success by framing it.\n\n&gt;\"Why is there always a conspiracy that means we can't in anyway lessen the power of the richest people?\"","created_utc":1513759761,"score":13,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

This trains you to have a short memory, makes the amount of information feel overwhelming, and the answers provided by the manipulator to be highly desired due to how overwhelmed you feel.\n* Emotional manipulation is used to put you in a heightened state, as this makes it harder for you to employ logic. Inducing fear and anger are among the most popular manipulated emotions.\n\nWhat can you do?  It's important to maintain communication with them.

The election was all anyone really wanted to talk about even though there was really nothing that my progressive/liberal Dad could say that was going to break through the partisan entrenchment of our conservative relatives.  My Dad is for the most part a very mild-mannered guy.  He's very intelligent, but he does not like to hit people over the head with it.  He works as a college professor in a conservative rural community, so his job is basically to expose uninterested people to new ideas.  But whenever the conversation got too heated and unproductive my Dad would say in a kind of defeated sing-songy way \"You live in Texas.  Your vote doesn't matter.\"  This typically irritated my relatives enough to force a subject change.  When my Dad and I discussed this privately I told him he should probably stop saying that because it was only making the family madder.  He said \"I'm not really saying that for them, I'm saying it for me.\"\n\nIf there was ever a magical golden age where most Americans were curious and open-minded and willing to confront their preconceptions, it's long past.  You might be better off trying to convince your Mom to move to a non-swing state.","created_utc":1513788795,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Right wing polticicans don't always get the most funding but it's not ideologically inconsistent for a right wing politician to take the money of the rich and corporations.  It is for left wing polticians.\n\nThey can easily justify their means to an end.  Right wing polticis justifies social order by painting the change as domino or a slippery slope to some horrible future.  If you truly believe that liberals are going to bring about a Stalinist hellworld and you could stop that by purging a couple voters off the roles or deny a SCOTUS seat you probably would.  Its harder to do that from the left.\n\nThe purging of our more radical allies.  If you look back after WWII organized labor became revered.  They got governement contracts and a legitimized roles.  Then McCarthyism came it demanded the communist, socialists and anarchist to be kicked out of unions.  Withiut the radicals labor unions had hard time recruiting and became undemocratic and corrupt.  Only teamsters really saw much growth until their ties to organized crime were exsposed.  Without a lavor movement the left lost its practical down to earth advocacy, it loolex like a bunch of edgy kids, out of touch professors and coastal elites. Labor lost its inspiration, it looked more like a special interest, a corporatiin or worse.  \n\nWhich finally lack of solidarity and class conciousness.

{"author":"bp139","body":"I would say that it is definitely reasonable for European countries to want to decrease the number of refugees coming into the country. It is a tough situation though because it is illegal to deport the refugees under international law; however, at the same time, no one really cares if you break international law. Just ask the United States, we and our allies do it all the time. I think that there are also obvious concerns with Islamic ideology. Obviously, most Muslims are not Jihadists, but even if a very small proportion are, that is a huge problem. Also, a lot of their views go against western values; however, if your friend's theory of free speech holds up, the bad ideas should beat the good ideas and that shouldn't be a problem. I would also caution your friend with making comparisons to other countries, especially when they can only point to a single example. Each country is very different from one another, so what works for Japan, may not work for Europe. Especially, when you take into consideration the many counter examples. The US is built on multiculturalism, and most Middle Eastern countries are ethnostates. The US performs much better than Middle Eastern countries. In fact, I would say that ethnostates have done much worse than non-ethnostates. This would make sense because if the theory of free speech holds up, you would expect that having many different perspectives would improve political discourse. The counter to that is that it does come at the cost of greater political conflict in the country. The US has a federal system, so it works better here, but most European countries have a unitary system, so who knows.

{"author":"pillbinge","body":"You haven't listed your views, just that you disagreed with most (if not all) of your friends.  So I'll just assume you believed the opposite of his views you've presented.\n\nYour friend believes in something that's been around for a while but has never existed.  Ethno-states in the West have never existed like he imagines.  They barely exist like he thinks they do now.  He points to Japan as an ethno-state preserving its culture but after WW2, Japan adopted a lot of Western ideas.  As did much of Asia and many parts of the world.  Before WW2, Japan largely had different ideas about religion, tattooing, homosexuality, and even just the presence of underwear (which was introduced around that time, if not later).  You can look at photos of villages during WW2 and see it's a very different place.  Your friend is inadvertently defending multiculturalism, but ironically, a young, liberal, Japanese person who embraces gay pride and doesn't shame tattoos has more in common with someone from the 19th century than their immediate ancestors.\n\nHis views are old and based in rhetoric of a world that never existed.  Non-White people have been a part of Europe for thousands of years.  You can find art about it, and even famous figures like Pushkin were at least half-non-White.\n\nSo it's really not clear for anyone.\n\nThe word \"multiculturalism\" and \"diversity\" by extension mean something different to everyone.  What you can trace it back to is a period after WW2 where Europe realized that it needed to place nice with its neighbors or risk a worse war.  If I'm correct, it was Sweden in 1975 that first adopted multiculturalism as an actual prerogative, and other nations sort of followed suit.\n\nThing is, the 1970s and even 80s saw very small rates of immigration from within Europe and certainly from outside it.  It was in the 1990s that immigration rates skyrocketed in the West.  Yet the push came from the same ideas.  The architects of multiculturalism hadn't foreseen that sort of change.\n\nThere's also a dichotomy at its base.  If multiculturalism is allowing a group of people to come to your land and assimilate, then that isn't multiculturalism; that's just letting your people become darker skinned.  If it means allowing a group to come to your country and *not* assimilate, because they're expected to be something else, that really won't work after a generation.  You'd be purposely separating people for the sake of it, and people don't like that either.  So which is it?\n\nA lot of liberals like to feel nice about things because it's nice to feel nice, but they stop short of having a plan or an ultimate goal.  Immigration is a policy, just like anything else, and its purpose is to fill in gaps in labor.  If most immigrants come to your country to work menial jobs, then I'd say there's a huge problem.  Especially when it saturates the labor market that already exists in the form of native citizens.  But, that demographic is likely to vote conservative, who gut programs that would actually help them.  Ironically, if Democrats ever fixed education and healthcare and the like, they'd probably reduce the need for immigration, thus cutting out a portion of their base.  (That's why I secretly suspect they talk a big game and then flat out fail on purpose, almost.)\n\nYou should also ask if you would apply these fixes to another country.  A professor of mine years ago would point out a ton of stuff about race in the US, and joked about Europe being too White in some manner.  I asked her if she thought Nigeria was too Black, and she sort of waved it off.  But honestly, would you ever say that?  Would you say that Nigeria needs to literally lighten up?  Would you prescribe a random assortment of immigrants to that country from around the world to make it better by de-emphasizing Nigerian culture and giving space to another culture?  I rarely hear people talk about Japan being too homogeneous.  Rather, the same \"liberal-minded\" people talk about all the stuff they get right and glance over the fact that for a long time in Japan's history, Japanese people weren't allowed to leave and foreigners weren't allowed in.  And that they have a very homogeneous society due to their structure (I believe non-Japanese citizens can't get citizenship ever; their kids can get it if one spouse has it).\n\nImmigrants have never been the threat they're seen as, and thoughts of terrorism are overblown.  If we actually sat down and had a conversation about this though, it would be difficult for most to handle.","created_utc":1514094237,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"edwinjackson","body":"I started out life left of Bernie Sanders, but I\u2019m now right of Ron Swanson, here\u2019s why.\n\nI my early thirties I started operating a business.  Because of my liberal ideology, I believed there would be numerous tax loopholes available to me.  Honestly, there weren\u2019t.  The first quarter we were in business I was able to take $20k from the business, which was less than I was making as an employee before, but I had a tax bill of over $80k.  I consulted with multiple tax experts and used every legal deduction available to me, but no dice.  I had to take money from savings to pay it and keep the business afloat.  So, I do believe the wealthy pay more than their fair share.  We take all the risk and until recently only got to keep 40-50% of the reward.  That is beyond fair.\n\nIn my late teens my parents divorced.  I was several years older than my siblings, so I was away at college for the worst of it.  As my siblings got older, they got themselves in trouble financially and otherwise frequently.  By this time I was working professionally, so I always tried to help them out.  I let them live with me for a while, helped them get apartments, therapy, rehab, anything I could do to help them.  Each time it got worse.  They weren\u2019t learning anything from these experiences because I and other family members were softening the life lessons they needed to learn.  I realized I was being charitable toward them because it made me feel better, not because it was helpful to my siblings.  After a decade or so of this I began to see it everywhere in our society.  Our social welfare programs are designed to make us feel good about ourselves and give power to the politicians, but it harms the recipient because it makes them dependent.  And dependency is more dangerous than any gun.\n\nI was a liberal Democrat early in my life because my parents and my teachers were.  Every time the news was on, my dad would grumble about how the Republican never helped the working man.  All of these people I grew up with laid the blame for their problems at the door of the government.  I noticed those attitudes didn\u2019t stop at public policy.  They blamed their genetics for being overweight, they blamed their boss for not having enough money, they blamed the corporations or the government for everything else.  But I never saw their lives improve.  But each time I took a step down the conservative self-reliance road I made more money, I lost weight, and my relationships improved.  The indoctrination is real and it is tremendously harmful.  I see these same people complaining about the same problems on Facebook today as they did twenty years ago.  I see my dad in the cheap Alzheimer\u2019s house that Medicaid pays for.  So, I don\u2019t see liberalism as a useful philosophy for living ones life.  Conservatism rooted in self-reliance and freedom is more useful to me.\n\nI could go on, but please accept these few personal experiences as my sincere effort to improve your understanding of people who believe like myself.  It was a long and difficult road for me, and these aren\u2019t the easiest experiences to share.  But I think they add to the discourse, so I felt it was important to contribute.\n\nMerry Christmas everyone!","created_utc":1514128904,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

He still took some big money and PAC $ which isn't nothing, even though obviously far better than most candidates. It's not Bernie level, which is the way campaigns should be financed whether you agree with the dude or not. \n\nSplitting hairs though. I concede that Trump mostly self-funded his campaign. My comment wasn't that he was a classic sellout Republican because of campaign contributions (no self-respecting multi-billionaire ever SHOULD be cucked by donors if running for public office). It was that he governs like one. I give him credit for getting elected, but since taking office he's done very little, if anything, that could not have been achieved by Cruz, Pence, Rubio, whoever the fuck. Obviously, there is still time where that's concerned.\n\nMany of his positions shifted radically leading up to his announcement for president. He transparently tailors his beliefs to whatever makes the crowd roar, so to speak. And tbh they happen in far less time than a 30-year span with Trump. The same can be said for Hillary. These people just aren't... principled. They have few, if any, defining beliefs that you can take to the bank. That you can really TRUST they will hold firm on when the tides get rough. I mean, the guy outsources out the ass, including his own workers...\n\nYou gotta be flexible, but I want to believe your motivation transcends ego and gaining voters. For awhile I did actually agree with you, and I felt that Trump wouldn't waste his time running if he didn't want to do good in his heart. I'm not closed off to that possibility, but through his actions I just haven't seen anything from him that bucks the status quo yet. He's essentially just hard-right down the line, after what seemed to be a lifetime of holding at least some views across the spectrum. At the perfect time, no less. \n\nHis spiel just seems very convenient and manufactured to me, and considering he will likely enter his 2nd election as a bigger underdog than he did the first go-around... it's possible we never see Trump as a lame-duck president who can cut loose and isn't just influenced by the nearest partisan advisor in his vicinity. Not that I'd want that as a progressive, but I'd feel like he was more honest to America if he backs up his rhetoric and actually begins to lead the way he campaigned: as a legit populist.\n","created_utc":1514177222,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

There are about 65k+ limit per year, with extra 20K+ allowance for masters/PhD holders. \n\n H1B requires that the job that an applicant is applying to \"is not able to be filled by an equally skilled American at that time\" (This hasn't been strictly enforced to prove until now) And this is where the problem arises; companies doctor the documents and job descriptions to make it look like particularly skilled when its may not be, effectively barring plenty of qualified American job applicants. This happens a lot in low-level, barely skilled labor sectors, and as a result, low level skilled Americans do lose their jobs to low level immigrants/foreigners. Sometimes the whole H1B documents are falsified. Imagine if that unskilled immigrants comes with his/her families; more jobs would be taken away from unskilled American workers. (but hey, that's how Capitalism works right?) IT mills(especially Indian IT companies) also abuse H1B system with similar tactics. They file hordes of H1B to USCIS(sometimes with nonexistent people), and hopefully increase the chance to bring in their country's people to the US. \n\nTHis hurts not only Americans, but also legitimately qualified applicants (bachelor, Masters/PhD applicants). There are many international students in the US who want to find jobs after undergrad/graduate, but fradulent(both practically and legally) H1B applications get in their ways. Why? H1B is not individually evaluated, but randomly selected. Once the petition passes the basic requirements, they are randomly picked like a lottery. Meaning, no matter how great asset you may be to the US, you are as likely to be selected as another applicant who passed bare-minimum criteria. \n\n*I am an international student studying in the US.

I think instead you should ask these people, \"When has this Republican government sided with us workers over billionaires and big buisness\"?  \n\nBecause his SC is anti worker Gorsuch is basically a corporate bag man, read what he said about the freezing trucker.  The Tax reform made permanent tax cuts for corps instead of the working class.

{"author":"kajunkennyg","body":"As someone from the area where this happened, I'll give some local feedback. The oil field is devastated in south Louisiana. A town that use to be thriving called Houma is basically dead. All the major oil companies have pulled out. There's no work. A lot of my friends/family are affected by this in a huge way. They want jobs back. I saw this and posted about it on facebook and it seems most of my friends support this because they believe it will bring back those jobs. \n\nThis short term thinking is something I can understand, people are hurting but that's no reason to risk destroying the ecosystem. Since the BP spill, the crabs have never been the same. They are actually prohibiting harvesting crabs a couple months out of the year to try to help them come back. No one I know can remember the last time that happened. Also, shrimping hasn't been the same either. So people are supporting temporary jobs (we all know that eventually the area won't be able to rely on the oil industry) at the risk of destroying one of the best things about the area, the seafood industry, which will be around much longer than the oil industry. \n\nThe difference here is MONEY and when that is the objective, it never turns out good for the average Joe. Just like the factories and stuff up the east coast. Use to be tons of jobs there and they shipped that shit overseas. Left areas devastated. \n\nI really hope this doesn't pass.
