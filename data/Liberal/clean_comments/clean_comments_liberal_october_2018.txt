{"author":"joetwocrows","body":"Fear.  Bah.  Emotions when we need facts.  \n\nThese are two very different ideas, and conflating them is dangerous.  Hacking the voting machines will not be solved by federalizing the voting system.  If anything, having a single point of attack would make it easier.  Think about the security failures you get to read about then apply that risk to a single federal system.  And, no, the feds are not more capable at securing public systems than anybody else.  \n\nI could support a sound approach to updating the procedures for electing the four federal offices involved (President, VP, Senator and Representative).   However, the framers of the Constitution left election laws to the states for the precise reason each state had different qualifications for voters, and still do, and they wanted it that way.  There are many reasons, some to do with slavery, some with landownership, and other now unseemly requirements, but that's what they wanted.  Can we change it?  Yes.  Can we change it soundly?  I'm less sure. \n\nThe rest of this reply &lt;tl:dr&gt;  we have no idea what the actual risk is.  \n\nMr. Pierce (the Esquire article's author) draws on several sources of information.  In there is this quote \" But the truth is that no one has really looked for evidence.  Intelligence assessments are based on signals intelligence \u2014 spying on  Russian communications and computers for chatter or activity indicating  that they altered votes \u2014 not on a forensic examination of voting  machines and election networks. \u201cWe should always be careful to point  out that there hasn\u2019t been any evidence that votes were changed in any  election in this way, and that\u2019s a true fact,\u201d said Matt Blaze, a  computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a  voting-machine-security expert. \"  My takeaway from that is that we (Mr. Pierce, you, me, et al..) are only guessing at the likelihood of a voting machine hack.  We don't have real data.  Is it insecure?  Yeah, probably.  In my time as an IT jack of all trades I have seen some of the darndest security probblems, so I'm not going to say voting machines are secure.  \n\nWhat I do know, from over a decade of serving on election boards, is that the counting process is, in my neck of the woods (Idaho) a very detailed process involving multiple cross-checks to ensure only the exact number of properly cast ballots get counted, and only by verified registered voters.  Some counties (Ada) use machines, others (Camas) use multiple hand-counts, somewhat based on population.  And some use other counties facilities to ensure better procedures.  Now we ask, how could those votes be altered?  Ada County uses a hybrid system.  You're given a paper ballot, you mark your choices, and then the scanner reads the paper, encrypts the results, and sends it to the county.  Sort of like electronic chads.  The advantages should be obvious; your ballot is tallied back at the county election office immediately, the ballot number is recorded, but there is a physical backup (the ballot paper) in case of challenge.  Voting secrecy (or privacy, if you prefer) is maintained by never connecting the ballot number with a specific voter.  Instead, the voter record is strictly a paper process, no electronics to hack.  So, to affect the vote, a hacker would have to manipulate the scanners, or\/and intercept and rewrite, including the encryption, each ballot from each polling place, and\/or hack into the county election system and rewrite the counting program (did I mention several counting tests are run prior to the election and directly compared to the input paper ballots?), and\/or finally alter the results sent from the county to the Idaho State Secretary of State who must certify the results  So, there's a lot of places for a hacker to miss and flag an audit trail.  \n\nI have no idea about other states.  But, having each state have their own method means a hacker is going to have work very hard to affect multiple states, and probably multiple counties.  One precinct might be hard enough. I completely acknowledge that one precinct might be enough.  Cambridge Analytica proved that for targeting counties, and there are always races decided by less than 10 votes.  (Note, in Idaho, ties are known to have been decided by a coin flip.)  \n\nSo, no, one federal system is unlikely to be better than a multitude of local systems.

Your parties moral and ethical standards have been poised by the Trump syndrome. Deep inside you know this is true.\n\"Here\u2019s a list of the people who we know have not been interviewed:\n\nA suitemate of Kavanaugh\u2019s has now told the New Yorker he remembers hearing at the time about the incident Deborah Ramirez has recounted. Ramirez, who has been interviewed, had claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a dorm party at Yale. The suitemate, Kenneth G. Appold, now says he is \u201cone-hundred-per-cent certain\u201d that he was told the culprit was Kavanaugh. He does say he never discussed this with Ramirez, but he claims an eyewitness described the episode to him at the time. Appold has tried to share this story with the FBI, but there\u2019s no indication the FBI is willing to hear from him.\nA classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Georgetown Prep now strongly challenges one of Kavanaugh\u2019s assertions under oath. The person told the New Yorker that he heard Kavanaugh talk repeatedly about Renate Dolphin as someone \u201cthat everyone passed around for sex\u201d (the witness\u2019 words), and even heard Kavanaugh singing a rhyme that included the words \u201cyou wanna get laid, you can make it with REE-NATE.\u201d Kavanaugh (and many others) described themselves in their yearbook as a \u201cRenate Alumnius,\u201d but Kavanaugh has denied under oath that this was a sexual reference, claiming, ludicrously, that it was intended to show \u201caffection.\u201d\nThis classmate is not named by the New Yorker. But he put his name on a statement to the FBI and Judiciary Committee that makes this claim, and he is prepared to talk to the FBI. There is no indication this happened.\nJames Roche, one of Kavanaugh\u2019s roommates at Yale, has written a piece for Slate that claims Kavanaugh lied under oath about his use of slang and his drinking. Roche claims that Kavanaugh \u201cregularly\u201d blacked out. Roche has offered to talk to the FBI, but there\u2019s no indication this happened.\nRoche also pointedly added of Kavanaugh: \u201cHe said that \u2018boofing\u2019 was farting and the \u2018Devil\u2019s Triangle\u2019 was a drinking game. \u2018Boofing\u2019 and \u2018Devil\u2019s Triangle\u2019 are sexual references. I know this because I heard Brett and his friends using these terms on multiple occasions.\u201d Roche concluded that Kavanaugh \u201chas demonstrated a willingness to be untruthful under oath about easily verified information.\u201d\nNBC News reports that the FBI has not contacted dozens of people who could potentially corroborate the allegations against Kavanaugh or testify to his behavior at the time. This includes many people who knew either Ford or Ramirez at the time, and people who actually approached the FBI offering information.\nThe Post reports that Ramirez\u2019s lawyers provided the FBI with a list of more than 20 people who might have relevant information, but \u201cas of Wednesday, Ramirez\u2019s team had no indication that the bureau had interviewed any of them.\u201d\nBlasey Ford\u2019s legal team today put out a list of additional people who have not been contacted by the FBI, some of whom were prepared to corroborate that she had in the past discussed being the victim of a sexual assault by a federal judge.\nNeither Ford nor Kavanaugh have been interviewed by the FBI. As the Brookings Institution\u2019s Susan Hennessey points out: \u201cIt is inconceivable they could close a real investigation without re-interviewing Kavanaugh.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/plum-line\/wp\/2018\/10\/04\/heres-a-list-of-people-the-fbi-did-not-interview-okay-with-this-flake-and-collins\/?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_term=.bfec1d35c66e\n\n","created_utc":1538778392,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The provider of the list of potential appointees didn't have any preference whatsoever as to whom Trump picked from the list, meaning all of them were about as evenly qualified as any other. The only reason, it seems, that they forced him in, was to make a political statement. Any judge from the list would vote against RvW, but they had to pick, and vehemently stand by, one that has these accusations. What point is there to this other than a \"fuck you\" to liberals, and as a power move to \"put women in their place?\"  \n\n\nEven if she is referring to all republicans, constituents and politicians alike, is she wrong?

{"author":"Tofan_","body":"As a Republican, I dont think this will happen. Please try not to be confrontational, I just want to say something.\n\nMany of us do not want Roe Vs Wade overturned or other landmark cases. \n\nRegarding Kavanaugh, we can argue over temperament, or \"remembering exact details from 30+ years ago\". This however was not what was debated. Instead he was accused of atrocious crimes on national television.\n\nFor anybody, we should assume that person innocent until proven guilty no matter what the crime. This is the basis and foundation for fairness, impartiality and due process in regards to the law in the United States Of America.\n\n That said, I think we have an obligation for all of the silent voices of survivors AND victims everywhere, including those not in the USA. We set the standard for every country in the world to strive for and as responsible citizens I think every survivor AND victim needs to be heard and appropriate action taken. \n\nThe issue here, and please remember, this is my own personal insight. The issue was that nothing about Brett assaulting Ford was corroborated. Many on here will nitpick specific grammar or take \"stories\" from unreputable sources and say contrary. Please let me be clear in that if there was a witness who could corroborate Ramirez, Swetnick or Ford's story, they would have been contacted. The FBI is impartial and fair in regards to investigations, as shown through former director Comey's announcement of investigation into Hillary at the most opportune time. There are far too many anti-trump agents to allow an investigation to be constricted in such a manner that would change the outcome of such an important moment as this.\n\nI feel bad for Judge Kavanaugh because somebody was allowed to accuse him of atrocious crimes on national television in the Senate of all places. I feel bad for his family for having to go through the most disgraceful and regretful nomination process I think we as Americans will ever see. I am glad that a victim of sexual assault was able to be heard on a national stage. It shows that we still have a long way to go in regards to that aspect.\n\n I think that we forget due to our differences in opinion that our way of life is only possible because we all believe in it. We may not always agree on every solution, or even come to the same conclusion. The most important thing to me is that we remember we are all in this together. I want to be able to say \"Hey Bob, I dont agree, but I can see how it could help. Let's give it a shot\".\n\nNobody can do that on either side because all of us want to just go for the jugular anytime an opinion doesn't fit into our agenda. \n\n\n","created_utc":1538867524,"score":11,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Such fear can play a damaging role in the field of medicine, in light of the legal and ethical constraints and obligations of clinical practice and training. Physicians cannot refuse to see patients of a particular gender; nor can academic physicians limit their interactions with trainees or colleagues to only one gender because they are worried about being accused of sexual misconduct.

I hate trump and I hate that Kavanaugh was confirmed, but we still need to be rational. \n\nSo Roe v Wade took abortion (which was a states rights matter) and made it federally permissible. It also went a tad farther by legislating how freely abortions could be accessed in which trimester, something a court was never intended to do. This ends up being a big problem for the left because if abortion was granted at the behest of 9 people, 9 people can take it away. They should\u2019ve also enacted legislation during the Clinton years or early Obama years if they wanted to defend against its repeal. \n\nNow that the court is so republican (again, something I hate), the far more likely thing is that some abortion lawsuit finds its way to SCOTUS, and they repeal RvW by turning the issue back to the states. So Mississippi and Alabama will ban it entirely, while California may broaden the coverage they provide. Some people will be able to cross state lines, but as usual it\u2019s the very young and very poor who are most trapped if they live in abortion-banning states. \n\nAnd banning contraceptive for single women... come on.

I would do so if it meant my children and possible grand children would have reduced anxiety about the world they grow up in.\n\nAs I've gotten older, what I personally came to realize is that many problems around our world revolve around access to resources.

Has nothing to do with getting older and wiser, it has everything to do with what they grew up with that is now \"under attack.\" \n\nI'd think today's youngsters that fight for LGBT rights will become the racists when people want to marry aliens from other galaxies. As society becomes more and more tolerate as a whole, those who do not agree (normally the previous generation(s)) will fight and scream louder than the majority will. This gives the illusion that older people become more conservative, when for their time period they were probably very liberal, and stopped adapting as they got older and their \"liberal\" ideas came to fruition. The next generations liberal ideas will just be too far for them, and when they die off, the country moves a step forward. \n\nFor example, more of the country is becoming non-religious. They will have kids that will probably follow that trend. So on and so forth until today's controlling religions become like the Greek Gods. Think of how many conservatives today base their views off of the Bible. Imagine the next two generations not giving a shit about that book.

You might find some inspiration in this article:\n https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/i-dont-know-how-to-explain-to-you-that-you-should_us_59519811e4b0f078efd98440\n\nBut the idea that you necessarily get more conservative with age is just patently false, as many other commenters here have shown. It could be that people tend to become more set in their political views as they age. If you start out liberal (after you've gone out on your own and developed political ideas independent of your parents), you'll get more liberal. Young liberals often start from a mindset that takes a range of experiences into account. As you gain more experience in life, having that mindset means you will continue to take in a greater range of experiences than someone who stays in their comfort zone. If that mindset is what makes you a liberal now, then gaining life experience can only reinforce those values.\n\nEdit: Come to think of it, telling you that you only think that way because you are young is a type of ad hominem attack. Your opinion is invalid because you're too young to know better, not because there's anything wrong with the opinion itself. It's a classic fallacy.

Then by extension, since they've worked so hard, they want less taxes so they can keep more of their money. Then, since they're successful in this meritocracy (in their minds it is), they have done the right things. They are smart, well educated, they know what's best.

Rent control is considered a dirty word but is often necessary to prevent owners of community housing from raising rates exponentially.\n\n* We can regulate the markets like we used to in order to discourage excessive bubbles that raise housing prices exponentially. We can also subsidize certain industries to artificially control prices like with food.\n\n* We can mandate wage increases to match the cost of living.\n\nOr we can implement some combination of the three.\n\nCost controls aren't popular and aren't very capitalist, so Republicans aren't going to allow that.

{"author":"tennessee_jedi","body":"IMO the most concerning aspect of this whole debacle is how Judge (now Justice) Kavanaugh comported himself during the Ford hearings. Instead of the restrained, dignified demeanor we've come to expect (and should demand) of those tasked with deciding the nation's most important legal issues, Kavanaugh came out and disregarded centuries of precedent. While there are - and should be - ideological differences among the justices, the SCOTUS ought to be above the petty partisan squabbling characteristic of the other two branches of the Federal Gov't.\n\nHe could have made his case just as well in a restrained, dignified, and most importantly non-partisan manner. Instead he came out and blamed the entire situation on disaffected Democrats, claiming that residual anger over the 2016 election was what somehow caused a woman to invite death threats and uproot her life to level her accusations. Not only that, but he singled out the Clintons, and turned the whole ordeal into the type of partisan farce we've come to (unfortunately) expect from congress; but not from the Supreme Court. If his behavior during the hearings is any indication of how he will function as a justice, then i expect public support for the Court (the only branch of government with a positive approval rating among the American people) will falter, leaving all 3 branches of government teetering; which would be catastrophic for public trust in the federal government as a whole.\n\nI did a more in depth write up of my take on this issue here: \n\nhttps:\/\/constitutevoice.com\/2018\/10\/03\/brett-kavanaugh-is-unfit-to-serve-on-the-supreme-court\/ \n\nif anyone's interested. I just hope that this issue will fire up democrats as much or more so than republicans to get out and vote next month. I know it's been said (and has probably been true) every 2 years for the last 8 at least, but this election is the most important in recent memory. the Dem's must take the house to reign in some of the damage the Trump admin is doing; and if they can take the Senate (a huge longshot, but not impossible) they might even be able to turn back the tide of anti-intellectualism, climate change denial, and economic illiteracy (tariffs!? are you fucking kidding me!?) that's swept our country since January of 2017; or even January of 2010 if you want to go all the way back to where a lot of this began in earnest. \n\nGet out and vote. Get your friends and relatives out to vote. Canvass for candidates you believe in. The importance of this shit cannot be overstated. If the R's keep the house and senate, they'll have a mandate and who knows what they'll do then.

Kavanaugh brought the petty partisan squabbling of congress into the hearings. rather than the dignified, non-partisan demeanor we ought to demand of our SC Justices he went full Republican attack mode. \n\nRather than focus on ideological issues, as has been the precedent for centuries, he framed the hearings as D v. R; not right v. left. you may not think there's much of a difference, but there is, and when it comes to the SC its an important one. There have always been, and should always be ideological differences among the justices, however theyve done well to distance themselves from the petty red team v. blue team squabbles. If his behavior during the hearings is any indication of how he'll function as a justice it does not bode well for the SC.\n\nI've posted it numerous times, but the Judicial is the only branch of our federal government with a positive approval rating among the american people. Congress is just above single digits, and Trump is in the 30's. The SC has stayed in the high 60's for decades, with very little change, because they are seen as above the partisan fray of Washington.

Grind that economy to a halt by having so few show up for work that change must be required.  It's worked in for more authoritarian regimes than ours.  We could remove trump from office within a couple of weeks or less if just enough people were upset enough to stop going to work.  Congress cares less about their base than they do their donors.  The tax bill, unpopular as it was is good proof for this.  Those donors care about making money.  If they lose enough money for backing Trump than not backing him then we would quickly see Congress change their loyalties quickly away from him.  But they make a lot of money off of Republicans.\n\nUntil such a day is required the best thing to do is vote.  Show up.  Millions more showed up for Clinton.  And she wasn't the most popular of candidates.  Get others to show up.  Make it important.  Make it known it's our duty our future relies on our participation.  It's a shame how few vote.  There are enough on the left to take this country back despite the voter suppression and gerrymandering.  It takes the slightest of efforts for most people.  In a fair and free democracy the people get the government they deserve or so the saying goes.  The easiest way to lose is to never try.  Apathy and laziness is our democracy's greatest threat.  Right now we still have the choice.  Soon we may not.  Republicans have started already to run out of voters.  Margins matter.  They've long since resorted to cheating.

The current one will win at any cost (legally), and will use political strategies, such as insults, which, unfortunately, work really well, as well as digging up their past. This isn't something new, many on the left have done this while campaigning and that has shown it very effective. What I am personally seeing, is that candidates are pointing out hypocrisy or mistakes in a opponents past, like Beto's DUI that Cruz brought up, and using it as a political launchpad for their campaign. The current Congress is a representation of the current and possible future voting base, a non-norgiving one who wants to win no matter who's feelings are hurt. I also see the current Congress trying to appeal to the most politically motivated generation in a long time, who are going to be a major voting block soon, Gen Z.\n\n  All of this considered, and being written on a whim, it is a very accurate representation of the conservative view, the only difference, they aren't willing to meet in the middle, which many, especially many boomer voters, do not like.","created_utc":1539226055,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

It's a class issue and a racial issue because people without ID are often lower socioeconomically and\/or are racial minorities. The strategy here basically explains itself: Republicans know which groups historically vote for Democrats, and they over and over again use legislation as a weapon to prevent them from voting.\n\nOne would think that democracy should be something we all agree on. That it isn't tells you volumes about the opposition. The GOP like that laws like this prevent people from voting too many times or voting in multiple states or voting without being citizens. They've insisted on having their way, so this topic has been studied. Anyone who had studied this will tell you that voter fraud (people breaking voter laws) is so rare as to be virtually nonexistent. Meanwhile, election fraud (politicians and campaigns breaking election laws) happens all the time, and it's the Republicans who obstruct attempts to strengthen these laws. The party of treason.\n\nThe most direct answer to your question, though, is that there is a long tragic history in this country of reactionary racists from the conservative party passing state level laws to turn away black people from the polls. We've learned in the US that these laws come back over and over unless activist groups watch carefully and fight them on it, and one of the ways is to make very clear the relationship of each new attempt to its Jim Crow roots. That the GOP is still trying these tricks with a lazy coat of paint is unspeakable, but predictable.\n\nSomebody follow up with one of those videos of GOP assholes getting caught on tape admitting what they're doing. \"We need to pass voter ID so we can win in November.\"","created_utc":1539372336,"score":22,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

To be honest, I am quite liberal in the traditional sort; being that I support free trade and immigration (so long as it is legal and the visa process is respected), but I find that most of the traditional values of liberalism has become a conservative set of values, as many liberals are more supportive of open borders, nationalised industry, and welfare without any checks, \n\nI\u2019ll copy and paste what I stated before: The reason why people are shifting between parties is because of the representation of each of the parties on media and other platforms. You never see the average, moderate, and decent person in the news, you see the screaming, angry and most occasions, the crazy ones. This applies for both the right and left wing. Just as you all would have seen the attacks in Charlottesville as representative of the right wing, we see the doxing and antifa violence as distinctly left wing. As for what you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all a matter of perspective, depending on what media you consume, and others. For example I don\u2019t watch Fox News, but I\u2019ve seen non partial clips from cnn and YouTube and frankly I found that the right wing shares more of my views than the left wing.","created_utc":1539394525,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"SnarkOilSalesman","body":"Your analysis of that metric really needs some nuance. There is no even distribution of the disenfranchised throughout America. Specific groups of people in specific geographical areas do not have an ID that the republicans require because those same republicans have made it so that the DMV, or other ID issuers, are only open one or two days a month. That\u2019s if they don\u2019t close down DMV\u2019s and polling stations entirely.\n\nIn addition, republicans constantly change the requirements for even getting an id, and will require specific pieces of information that their targeted minority is not likely to have. e.g. in North Dakota, republicans disenfranchised native Americans by requiring ID with a non-po mailing address, which the reservations do not have. In Wisconsin, it\u2019s a nonsense list of vital records that nobody ever has on them combined with a several week waiting period, an asinine process involving saving paper receipts, and no open DMV\u2019s in specific low income neighborhoods.\n\nIn the areas where the republicans engaged in targeted voter suppression, legislative and state elections were stolen with margins that were orders of magnitude less than the number of people disenfranchised.\n\nMost importantly, this scheme seems to occur heavily in states that have over representation in EC points. E.g. in Wisconsin, again, the state declared a result that had Hillary with 20,000 votes less than Trump.

It's just an acceptance of the government as being \"the country\", or like simply obtaining citizenship is enough to make one a civic nationalist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a Liberal my thoughts on Patriotism are solid. I'm a patriot. I love this country, I defend this country, I'm proud of my identity as an American. Being an American is unique in that being American is a choice. We have the freedom to leave or stay as we see fit. But I'll always be an American. If I move to China, I don't become Chinese. If I move to Mexico I am not suddenly Mexican. But a Mexican or Chinese person can become an American (even though our racism will still add the hyphenated \"Mexican-American\" or whatever to their entire family for generations, but that's a different subject I think).\n\nI see no way in which patriotism and Liberalism could be in conflict.

{"author":"anarchistcyberpraxis","body":"Thank you for the comment. This is the type of comprehensive answer I was hoping to get through the post. \n\nI should clarify, I was involved in American liberalism specifically. I used to live in the US, and I was involved with the John Kerry presidential campaign. That was my main contribution to liberal political activism in the US. I got to meet Kerry a few times and John Edwards once, which was cool. Although obviously we didn't win. But anyway, yeah you're right, liberalism is evolving, so I should specify that I was involved in liberal movements mostly during the Bush era in the US. I was a big supporter of Obama at first, but became disillusioned pretty quickly. Then I left the US, and I haven't been at all involved in liberal movements outside the US, mostly only been active against them to be completely honest haha. \n\nIn terms of your curiosity about what I mean about the distinction between liberalism and leftism: \n\nWell liberalism is certainly an ill-defined term that takes on vastly different significance in different contexts. But the unifying factor in all definitions is the primacy of the *individual* as the core building block of society, and the promotion of said individual's rights. According to most political theory, liberalism sees the empowerment of individual liberty as the optimal goal of the state. The Democratic Party (in its more mainstream form) is the obvious example of liberalism in the US. \n\nLeftist politics also vary wildly depending on faction, region of the world, time period, etc. But a unifying feature on the left is the primacy of the *collective,* rather than the individual. We tend to favour the rights of the group over the individual. Democratic Socialists of America, Party for Socialism and Liberation, etc. are the most apt US examples. \n\nIn the mainstream American lexicon the terms seem to be pretty interchangeable despite the massive differences here. Many Democrats are certainly left-leaning, and some have recently adopted some rather illiberal policies. Anyway, I don't want to go too in depth with this, I was just responding to your curiosity about how I see the distinction. I know this was political philosophy\/political theory rather than concrete stuff haha. It's just that my opposition to liberalism is on a more philosophical level in many ways, and political philosophy has been my field of research so I thought I'd share my ideas about the distinction in this way. \n\nThank you for the responses about patriotism and nationalism, interesting insights. Although as a leftist I do see it very differently to be honest. I completely oppose both patriotism *and* nationalism. I used to be quite patriotic as an American, but my research and then professional work eventually instilled in me a hatred for most US institutions and US mainstream culture haha. But anyway, the post isn't about me so I won't get into that haha. I wanted to hear from some people who identify as liberal on the matter, and I got that from you, thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1539634539,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Z3CHS","body":"I\u2019d argue that authoritarianism can fall on either side of the political spectrum. I\u2019m not entirely certain of the authors intention, but I hope with some context I can attempt to answer the question with my opinion on fascism in 2018 America. \n\nFascism was able to gain traction in Italy and Germany due to a wide array of factors. The fear of Bolshevism and global interests were driving forces that allowed the fascists to obscure political and societal norms and gain the support of the people. \n\nIn the case of Germany, Hitler after the passing of the enabling act was given dictatorial powers. He essentially merged positions from within the NSDAP with government positions. For instance, the Chief of Police was merged with the SS reichsf\u00fchrer. This effectively made the paramilitary wing of the NSDAP in charge of the nations policing. It made an independent Non-partisan institution a tool of the NSDAP. Over a very short span of time, Hitler consolidated his power, jailed or executed his political rivals and destroyed all democratic norms of the Weimar Republic. \n\nThe enabling act was drafted in 1933, but the rise of the NSDAP party began in immediately following WWI. \n\nOne point to consider was that Germany was a unitary state with a relatively small government. It can be argued that because there was less bureaucratic institutions to \u201cwin over\u201d and control, that it allowed for a very easy seizure of complete governmental authority. \n\nNow if we take a look at the situation in America, we can see similarities, although not a direct comparison, between the behavior of Trump and the republican party and the NSDAP. \n\nIn the Trump Era, we have seen Trump wither and destroy public trust in institutions that have been historically non partisan. The FBI, CIA, NSA and the Justice Department. Trumps rhetoric and in turn the modern GOP speaks to conspiracies of George Soros, Deep State operatives and Hilary Clinton being part of a secret globalist cabal (similar to the conspiracy theories of Bolshevik Jews controlling the global order). \n\nWe have seen the Office of The President grow in power under Trump. We have seen the rush by the GOP to stack the courts with partisan judges after Mitch McConnell starved them during the Obama years. We have seen the GOP exploit gerrymandering, utilize voter suppression, and potentially utilize the 2020 census to consolidate and maintain their power. We are seeing a systematic dismantling of democratic norms in the aim of maintaining GOP control indefinitely. \n\nNow to answer your question. We visually associate fascism with overt military dress and national symbols. The rhetoric typically expresses xenophobia and the outlying threat of a global conapiracy. These cartoonish aspects of early 20th century fascism would be too obvious and quite frankly silly in the 21st Century western world. \n\nHowever, If you take away the semantics, syntax and the veil military dress and parades, the behaviors of the GOP and their aim to consolidate power is strikingly similar to the NSDAP. \n\nI\u2019d argue that the US government is a lot bigger and has more bureaucratic institutions loyal to the country than Weimar Germany (which was relatively unstable) did and thus a transition to full blown fascism is far more unlikely and difficult. \n\nHowever, remember earlier when I stated that the enabling Act was passed in 1933? Well, the NSDAP rise to power occurred from 1918 - 1945. \n\nThat being said, think of how the US government will change over the next 6 years. How it will become increasingly authoritarian, less democratic and with little to no checks on the executive. \n\nMy question is, what comes after Trump, after this period of governmental chaos, a starved state department. Now throw a global economic meltdown into the mix, what happens next? It\u2019s a dangerous place to be for the leader of the free world. \n\n\nTL:DR The author is saying the GOP is seizing power and utilizing the fascist playbook without looking like the empire from\nStar Wars.

This is the fundamental concept of how propaganda works. These are pavlovian responses imbedded into their psyche by fear. The USA is roughly 4% of the globes population and only approximately 40% of that 4% hold these opinions steadfast. 96% of the earth's population has sensible understanding of climate change and participated collectively to work towards solutions. 96% of the population of the globe doesn't participate in a gun obsessed culture so detrimental, that it has become the leading cause of death for their youth under the age of 25, with the reasoning that a hypothetical revolution may take place and possession of a firearm alone will remove the need for any physical or tactical training whatsoever. As an outside spectator observing the human species you would see only 40% of 4% of the earths human inhabitants simply refuse to evolve and prevent 2 major obstacles in the continuation of their species, which is the very essence of their pure existence, and biological instincts.

{"author":"Machizadek","body":"Your comment shows ignorance. Conservatism is a political view or ideology. There are policies that hold to concervative views? But otherwise the policies you're referring to as conservative (I assume) are actually republican which hasn't been truly concervative in a long time but instead is full of statists, idiots, and essentially slow motion liberalism. Instead conservatism is fear of change and traditional viewpoints (which is why conservatism and libertarianism are so closely tied). The entire point of conservatism is to reduce the amount of central control and minimize government policies and spending so that we can minimize taxes and thus help boost the entrepreneur and\/or individual. But when was the last time a republican actually did anything to minimize the government? Every Republican president for the past long time has instead grown the government. \n\nSo if someone's a conservative what do they believe? 1. They are often statists. 2. They (in america) believe a state generally knows best how to take care of their own population. 3. They usually believe in limited immigration. 4. They usually are fond of capitalism and the wonderful wealth its brought the developed countries its instituted in. 5. They believe they have a right to self preservation (right to bare arms essentially as well to defend oneself with them). 6. They believe in personal responsibility and that the governments only role is to preserve property rights and to make rights equal enough that everyone is free to pursue their own goals. 7. They believe in free markets (aside from regulations to protect property rights). 8. They believe that the government is allowed to take minor taxes but only to pay for public goods (military, schools, roads, prisons, ect.) 9. They also believe in a powerful national defense. So powerful actually that most support intervention to stop war. 10. Which brings us to our last aspect of conservatism belief, which is they are interventionists. \n\nOf the things in this set of beliefs that you might point out as wrong or stupid (in my libertarian perspective) I would include 1, 9, and 10. 3 and 8 are more complicated but I have a different view.

Fascism is strongly leftist at its core (Mussolini also was a former socialist, one of his lovers was also one).\n\nGentile was the first and important ideologist of fascism, together with Mussolini . His is a strongly activist and actualist political philosophy (that is, he wants to transpose actualism into the civil and social field), which combines \"praxis and thought\", which is both \"an action to which a doctrine is immanent\".  Being dissatisfied with the front of reality, in Gentile we find the primacy of the future, but at the same time a recovery of the romantic conception of the inexhaustible universal spirit which all durchdringen, opposed to materalism and instrumentally instrumental reason. \\[48\\] \u200b\u200bFor Gentile, for example, the \"general way of conceiving life\" proper to fascism is \"spiritualistic\". \\[47\\]\n\nFascism is not the only political qualification of its philosophy, Gentile in fact also liberal, although it seems to reject almost fully the nineteenth-century liberalism in the doctrine of fascism. It is a conceptual policy that is a conceptual Hegelian of the ethical state, but also a free ninth individual atomistically and materialistically integral, and in the state of solvent in its historical process.

Another generalization I know but the point of my argument was to point out the hypocrisy of the generalized comment from the article).\n\nAs to why I see the radical left as worse than the right? The \"right\" that is referred to, which is essentially just trump followers, are doing things that is pushing us into essentially an isolationist country. That's what I've seen most from trump's policies. He has also done a lot to make sure of his control in office. Both of these things are scary but are still a far way off from fascism. More like the first steps towards what could be.... maybe. The only actual worrisome aspect comes from his followers absolute apathy towards any morally reprehensible thing trump does. Not to mention the right is actually the one in office right now. Even so, I dont believe trump has near enough power to ever implement actual facism. Another commenter mentioned a point I liked. That the scariest aspect of it all isn't trump but who comes after trump to further his ideas. Sadly though, these same precedents trumps set can be utilized by Democrats. \n\nThe left is scary because (ironically) their acceptance of identity politics and speech control. Not to mention the constant radical proposals in changes to legislation. Everything from guilty without proof, to taking away guns, to gigantic socialist states and centralized power to even fully socialist\/communist government proposals. Antifa riots or shows violent support for many peaceful leftist protests and even right wing protests. Contrast this to the alt right\/proud boys movement and you see a lot less members, A belief they should be allowed to do what they want. Most alt right members left the group when the extremist nationalist and white supremacists jacked their platform. There is actual legislation in place in Canada limiting free speech (based on peoples preferred gender). \n\nI'm not saying the right is much better. Nor do I mean to group the entire left together. I understand the argument for healthcare. 60% of poverty is considered to be caused by medical expenses. I simply disagree that government controlled healthcare is the solution. Especially considering our current tax expenses and lack of trade liberation. People arguing for soft socialism like this aren't necessarily wrong. It's just a gray area I disagree with.

Sometimes a person is given all the financial\/familial opportunity and support in the world and still finds a way to squander it.\n\nI agree that it can be a very effective and motivating mindset to believe that life's outcomes are 100% within one's own control, but you yourself have halfway conceded this is not a factual reality by acknowledging that there are certain things that a person has no sway over.\n\nBeing headstrong and self-sufficient is extremely valuable in life, FAR more valuable than being weak-minded, dependent, and constantly blaming others people. Stephen Curry probably believes he will make a three-pointer every time he shoots one, which likely helped him reach the level he reached. But that's statistically never been the case, because it's impossible to make every shot.\n\nI don't think most liberals think that the victim mentality is a good attitude to push. More that we feel some people actually ARE (to some extent) victims of circumstances outside of their control.

The problem is that people who believe in this illusion of everyone being in total control of everything that happens to them won't even acknowledge the above-mentioned factors (nationality by birth, access to education, socio-economical background) as being of relevance at all.

{"author":"Samvega_California","body":"I think it's clear what republican politicians want: More money for the wealthy and a feudalistic society of oligarchs. I think your question, if I interpret it correctly, is about the voters. Why do they vote republican? Here's my take, which is based on having spoken to my republican friends and neighbors:\n\nEveryone in the country perceives and feels the decline of upward mobility, the shrinking of the middle class, and the ineptitude of our leaders to do anything about it. Every single family in America is feeling the economic pinch, but there's also so much more change happening right now that, to some people, feels a lot like the decline of society into something dangerous. As an example, Just last week our society reached, for the first time ever, a scenario where most children are born outside of marriage. All around us we see well established norms and demographic majorities that have held true for decades disintegrating. Neighborhoods that have always been middle class white neighborhoods with nuclear families look increasingly less likely to be so in short order. The liberal and conservative reactions to these changes are very different, and this is where I find most republicans are coming from. They are voting out of fear. Fear of change, and fear of the other. It's not rational, so don't try to rationalize it.\n\nA good book to help liberals and conservatives understand each other is \"The Righteous Mind: Why  Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion\".","created_utc":1540125373,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Real top quality work.\n\nSo anyways.\n\n&gt;  What does America get from the Christian form of Sharia?\n\nNothing.  Theological law isn't an objective of the Republican party.  I  think you're thinking about abortion, which is complicated.  The answer to the question \"When does life begin?\" is fundamentally unknowable.  There are people that *literally* think abortion is *literally* murdering a baby.  The government takes tax dollars from them and gives those dollars to Planned Parenthood, who make a profit from those dollars, and who also provide abortion services.   This makes some people upset.  If you think that's unreasonable then you seriously lack some empathy.\n\n&gt;  What does America gain from wealthy paying less taxes\n\nMost taxes are paid by relatively wealthy people.  A *lot* of people pay almost no taxes.  Because of this, any tax cuts can be spun as \"tax cuts for the wealthy\", even if the actual objective is simply to lower the overall tax incidence.\n\nTaxes cause a deadweight loss, which is why it's generally a good thing to cut taxes.  \n\nPreviously, our business income taxes were among the highest in the world, which caused problems for Americans and our businesses.  Corporate income taxes are largely paid for when companies reduce the wage growth of their employees.  Corporations were incetivized to use accounting tricks to avoid paying income taxes, which reduced their ability to expand operations inside the united states.  Cutting the corporate income tax to match global standards was good because the incidence of the corporate income tax is largely regressive, and because the unusually high US rate incentivized behavior that was bad for businesses and bad for Americans.\n\nThere's also the question of what the taxes are used for; legitimate purposes (public goods) and illegitimate purposes (private goods).  Half of our budget right now provisions healthcare and retirement benefits, which are both private goods.\n\n&gt; cutting in programs that help poor and underprivileged\n\nEntitlements are hugely expensive, aren't that effective, and eliminate the capacity of people to engage in meaningful spending or saving.  You'll need to be more specific if you want me to be more specific here.\n\n&gt; blowing up of the deficit so the wealthy have more money?\n\nI'm pretty sure \"blowing up the deficit\" isn't happening \"so the wealthy have more money\".   Debt, gdp, arguments for\/against fiscal conservatism (which isn't necessarily a position of the Republican party anymore) are topics in economics that are a bit over my head at the moment.  The reality is that it's politically difficult to stop spending money, which is one reason why the purse strings ought to be tight.\n\n&gt; How does restricting women's rights making the country better?\n\nOk lol.  Please uh.. point me to the policy.  This is egregiously stupid.  You should be better than this.\n\n&gt; How is voter suppressions and gerrymandering leading to a better country?

{"author":"EndTimesRadio","body":"Alright, I'm offering, but I wanted to see if I'd just get downvotes for even trying to supply one. Pardon as it's 4:30 AM where I am, as I'm abroad for the moment.\n\nFirst on the agenda is they want to restore a monoculture (not mono-racial society, but a mono*cultural* society). To them, multiculturalism is a terrible idea, and there do seem to be drawbacks that the left is purposely ignoring. Read Roosevelt's \"Hyphenated Americans,\" if you want to read what I'm on about- but apply it to race, now, too, and that's how most of them think. There's also good articles as to why the \"proud boys\" is surprisingly racially diverse- it's culturally chauvinistic, but doesn't seem to actually care about *race*. We seem to mix up race and culture a lot, which is to our detriment.\n\nSecond is that they understand something fundamental: \"America First.\" A nation of Americans should prioritise the well-being of Americans. We have literal tent-cities sprouting up. It is true that to get our way on the global stage, we have allowed other countries to take advantage of us economically via lopsided trade deals or not holding countries accountable when they don't hold up their end of a bargain or given foreign aid to make certain policies happen as part of soft power projection.\n\nThat means foreign aid to random countries while we're sliding into debt is at *least* bad optics. We *are* sliding into debt. We *are* going bankrupt through the sheer number of \"programs\" we have, and alphabet soup agencies and growth of admin bloat. \n\nAnd so, let's talk taxes, and where it's all going.\n\nThere's also an aspect of the work ethic of 'if your benefits pay $11\/hr., and wages pay $9\/hr., people will be distinctly unhappy about it, likely take neither, but would honestly prefer to work the job they had before policies made it extremely disadvantageous to keep that job here so the mill closed and relocated to China when it joined the WTO,' even though from a logic perspective that mindset makes zero sense- the 'logical move' is to get on welfare. But that runs against the culture. \n\nThis is why they hate social programs. As someone who's worked for nonprofits, I can tell you: most of it gets wasted. I'm not talking salary, I'm talking expense after expense, lots of wasted fuel, lots of wasted time, lots of people half-assing it in ways that would make your blood boil if you saw it firsthand.\n\nMany of these voters are taxed highly, and you need to understand that what comes back to them in services, especially in rural areas, is pretty low. Most of it exists in urban areas, including transit, municipal wifi, etc., and in the country there is less reliance on others\/agencies\/companies for everything from safety through permits. Therefore, they're not really 'voting against their own interests.' The idea that they are needs to die, fast, because it is counter-productive to understanding them and their needs. https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2016\/4\/21\/11451378\/smug-american-liberalism This is a good article on that, and also why respect is important, because you can't understand a people's needs and also disrespect them, let alone serve them well. If someone can't respect them, they are justified in saying they have literally no reason to vote for that person, because that person has no grasp of what they're facing.\n\nA service economy also requires a certain population density to survive, and the Democrats keep pushing it as 'jobs' that they can pursue, even though there aren't data centres or stock markets or trade centres or anything much like a service economy in the midwest- so when people dump \"smokestack economy\" jobs for \"service economy\" jobs, the heartland suffers. And many senators, especially those from coastal states who have never even been to the heartland, get it into their head to try and run for higher office or serve within a department, they have no idea why they're disliked by (geographically) the majority of the country's landmass.\n\nThey have no grasp of the region's struggles, or reasonable fixes for it, and create no reason to vote for that party. \n\nLots of mom-and-pop cottage industries that are hanging on by fingernails are trying to get their good added to the tariff list, seeing it as a last-chance to return to profitability before otherwise having to declare bankruptcy as China is trying to monopolise the market. To these voters, China is the #1 threat to America, and we've been ignoring them for far too long.\n\nSorry, this is way rambling. It's late, I'm tired, this is a start, forgive how dumb it all sounds. ","created_utc":1540147863,"score":10,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Lack of consequences for crime is another factor.\n\nI think in modern America, we have pretty serious consequences for our crime, at least at the street level, so I don't think increasing punishment from the actual shooters is going to make a difference. However, there is a sense that people who run and profit from organized crime can act with reasonable impunity. Perhaps if we were more effective at unseating the corrupt and removing the incentives of people to be on the fringes of criminal activity, that might drive crime down.\n\nLikewise, we're not doing very much to deal with poverty, especially for street-level offenders who commit minor crimes and then have their economic prospects ruined. We could devise a system that helps them get back on their feet, and disentangle them from neighborhood criminal activity.\n\nBasically, a lot of gun control is trying to treat the symptom (people getting shot during crime) instead of the disease (the high crime rate itself).","created_utc":1540151259,"score":7,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"TheSkepticalTerrier","body":"I'm not sure If you read my comment in it's totality (or if I merely was unclear), but Liberals as well exploit emotion. This is true. Some of those emotions are fear (Trump is Hitler, current Gun Laws, the possibility of Fascism), and again, whether or not those emotions are valid is beyond the scope of my comment. Politics, Beliefs, play on emotions. We cannot think of either side as completely rational actors. Saying that conservative fear is completely different, ignores the fear mongering used. Hillary didn't just want to take the second amendment, says the right, she wanted to take the first as well. She wanted an authoritarian rule, she was a corrupt politician, too cozy with wallstreet, and she was hiding everything in them emails. These are all statements you can find at your local conservative subreddit, all play off of fear. There is a reason why political attack ads are generally used by the right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this is my point. It's emotions these things play off of, and it is not exclusive to the right, but the emotions played off of to the right are simple emotions. I don't want my money taken. That's fair. But we can't ignore without taxes the government can't function. And we need a functioning government to insure our safety and our liberty. It's fair enough to not want more socialism. But those socialist policies may help us in the long run (or they might not), and failing to consider those policies because of the dreaded \"s\" word damns us twice. First of which it sells a simple world, where there are socialist things and capitalist things, and socialism is bad and capitalism is good. And second that it pits us on a slippery slope, where one step toward socialism locks on a path to a socialist dystopia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with these is that political philosophies and economic policies are more complicated than that. There are good socialist programs, and bad capitalist effects. It seems to me that locking ourselves in one of these just condemns us to their worst aspects, and openly considering the best either has to offer may grant us a better world. Or it might not, it's still worthy exersize. It's also worth considering that the Slippery Slope is a logical fallacy, and the path to socialism isn't a straight line of socialist policies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'm mostly uninterested in the quality of either policies, as that is far outside of my point. My point is that Republicans sell a simple world view. One where if you take the rights of blacks or women, and subtract the rights of white people, and the difference is 0, then you're living in an equal society. But the world is more complicated than that. Opportunity, the attitude of the greater culture, social representation, housing, feelings of general safety, quality of education, etc, all play into social equality, and pretending that its amount of rights, shows merely that you've bought that simple world that they're selling, and you're quite happy with the product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing before I go. You said these two things in your post:\n\n&gt;Also not many people that I know actually think the money is given to people don\u2019t work. They just don\u2019t want their money taken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The redistribution of money is a good step towards socialism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps it's my misunderstanding (and feel free to correct me if it is), but it comes off as talking out of both sides of your mouth to say that no one is concerned about wealth redistribution, and then a few scant sentences later, opine concern about wealth redistribution. Either it's not a concern (then why mention it, and what's with the talk about welfare queens?), or it is a concern, and the reasons why can't just boil down to the dreaded \"s\" word. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is that both sides are playing off of emotions. And that is not a judgement, as beliefs are mainly emotions. But conservative emotions are more direct, reflect a worldview that is simple. Whereas liberals emotions are indirect. Stemming from complex anxieties, and a lack of simple answers. Or maybe sometimes they're both. It's complicated, after all.","created_utc":1540170546,"score":5,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Mr_Conductor_USA","body":"&gt; When it comes to people dressing up as stereotypical cultural beings like the Mexican wearing the sombrero or the Native American wearing the head dress, I still fail to see the issue. Stereotypes have a history of being an oppressive tool, but they are very much in line with the cartoonish, caricuture-like nature of the holiday. These costumes are representations of a trope. A trope that exists within our collective culture and our historical media. Its fair game.\n\nOh lord. \"Don't worry minorities, it's just a cartoonish trope! And that's okay!\"\n\nI'm sympathetic to your other arguments, but costumes that play into ugly racial or ethnic stereotypes are not okay, and neither are the war bonnet costumes, for reasons that have been explained ad nauseum by Native American activists. If you don't know what the symbolism means you're not being very respectful of other people's cultures. Is wearing a Nazi uniform on Halloween because it \"looks cool\" or \"it's scary\" okay? To many Native Americans putting on a fake war bonnet is really crossing a line to them.\n\nNative Americans today face a lot of political, legal, and economic oppression. It's not all in good fun. You know most liberals do understand why blackface is not okay. Maybe, just maybe, \"sexy squaw\" is not a cool costume for similar reasons? Especially when so many Native women are the victims of sexual assault?\n\n&gt; Cut all emotional ties to the phenomena we choose to represent with our costumes.\n\nNo. That's ridiculous.","created_utc":1540221528,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

One look at the ISP or health care insurance markets show that they are monopolistic, and that they work together to fix prices.  They will make someone fight over reimbursement for cancer treatments in order to make a profit for their shareholders.\n\nThe goal of government isn't, or shouldn't be, to profit.  They are there because they are ostensibly controlled by an electorate, not a small board of directors and shareholders.  \n\nI'm very happy to be out of the public insurance market and on Medicare:  I no longer worry about being able to afford something.  If you look at the bloated shell game we call health care insurance in the US, you will see the most wasteful for-profit system in the world.\n\nGovernment certainly has its issues, but you're wrong to make a blanket claim that privatizing always lowers the price.\n\nThere are also more considerations than lowering the cost.  Privatizing also has a lot of moral considerations, like when you privatize a prison  system, or as Erik Prince is suggesting, privatizing the entire Afghanistan war.\n\n","created_utc":1540222575,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

This is why the left is going to lose because you are not attacking the vast majority of conservatives actual policies or beliefs. You don't actually understand why conservatives vote the way they do. You may understand the issues but you don't understand why someone has taken the opposite side.\n\nYou probably see someone opposing affirmative action and you think racist. Yet, it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with individuals and the rights of individuals. It is not about a black person taking a spot from a white person but rather individual merit. The fact is that most people on the right wouldn't find it bad if a black student with a 3.0 GPA got into a university over a white student with a 4.0 GPA so long as that black student had other life experiences or even hardships that made him a more attractive student than the white student with the 4.0 gpa. It just has to be environmentally based or merit based. Ending affirmative action based on race really comes down to making sure that no individual is disadvantaged because of the way they were born.\n\nYou probably won't ever understand that argument but here is the difference between me and you. I also very much understand the liberal position for affirmative action. The fact is that in the past and to a much much much smaller extent today, there are structural issues that disproportionately affects a black individual from obtaining generational wealth, doing well in school, going to a good school, growing up in a good neighborhood, ect... Because of this, there is a gap between the wealth of black families and the wealth of white families and one might even want to try to reconcile past or current injustices with programs to help minorities. It is a valid argument, but I think that I can effectively attack the flaws in the argument and in such maybe even attack the flaws in some liberal's logic on this issue thus maybe having a chance at changing minds.\n\nYour argument by contrast isn't relevant to most conservatives because most conservatives don't actually believe what you think they believe.

{"author":"JonWood007","body":"Former conservative here.\n\nA lot of the voter base is naive and doesnt understand how the world works. If they did, they wouldnt be republicans any more (like Im not). \n\nGenerally speaking conservative voters have very ignorant and picture book views of the world. many are religious, so much so they put their religion above even country. When i was a conservative christian in christian school, I was taught god first, country second. That said, in such a fundamentalist view, god's law is absolute, and the country can either get in line with that or get punished. Read the bible. Read about how in the old testament, there was a constant tension between obedience to god and israel's success. If you obeyed, you were prosperous, if you disobeyed, you were punished. Which is why they have their weird views on sex ed, abortion, and gay marriage. They think if we allow these things and become godless, that god will punish us, which is why, i crap you not, people thought that hurricane katrina was god's punishment for gay people being tolerated. So to answer this:\n\n&gt;What does America get from the Christian form of Sharia\n\nIn their warped mind, it gets them prosperity. Because god blesses nations that obey him and punishes nations that don't. \n\n&gt; How does restricting women's rights making the country better?\n\nBecause the bible is misogynistic and therefore conservatives must be too.\n\n&gt; What does America get from the Christian form of Sharia? What does America gain from wealthy paying less taxes, cutting in programs that help poor and underprivileged, and blowing up of the deficit so the wealthy have more money?\n\nSo...here's the thing. Conservatives have....weird picturesque ideas of how the economy is supposed to work. They think capitalism is the greatest system on earth and is responsible for our prosperity, and have bought into a sort of stockholm syndrome in which they think any deviation from it makes it worse. minimum wage raises unemployment, higher taxes lead to less job growth, social programs distribute wealth from the middle class to the poor unfairly, and everyone should work and earn what they earn. Rich people deserve their money and taking from them is not only immoral due to their concept of property, but hurts the economy. Also, lots of cold war era propaganda in which liberalism is literally communism and threatens america's values.\n\nSpeaking of which, conservatives are values voters. They vote based on these values. They have an almost mythical concept of what america is based on the whole concept of the \"american civil religion\". Im just gonna link this.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_civil_religion\n\nAnyway, their viewpoints are simplistic and they wanna go back to what they considered a simpler time. They think that liberals have caused us to deviate from our values. They oppose social welfare going back to the new deal and are still fighting that battle, and at this point the people who lived in the pre new deal world are dead so they have this almosy mythical idea of small government and going back to 19th century ideals on the subject. On the constitution they treat it like a religious document and want it to go back to 1789. And honestly, again, everything wrong with america is liberals deviating from this mythical picture book idea of america in their head based on nostalgia of a simpler time they never actually lived through and would likely be horrified if they got. Their idea on government is that its tyranny and that by shrinking the size of government, they're making us more free. Speaking of which, blowing up the deficit is their way of forcing spending cuts. They sabotage our finances and then say we cant afford social programs...while turning the other way at tax cuts for the rich.\n\nIn reality....these policies benefit the rich. The republicans are a party that primarily benefits the rich. i'd argue at this point the democrats are too, but the democrats do a better job trying to hide it. The republicans are brazenly for the rich, and they support the elite class's interests, and they managed to fool half the country into believing that this is good for them.\n\nAs such the republican party is essentially the party of rich people....controlling middle class people via religion, fear of immigrants and brown people (yeah i didnt get into that but yeah..), and a fear that liberals are gonna screw everything up, in order to push interests that brazenly benefit the rich at the expense of everyone else. \n\n&gt;How is voter suppressions and gerrymandering leading to a better country? Exactly what is the goal?\n\nFrom the perspective of the average republican, you know, the people with the wool being pulled over them, it's:\n\n1) because democrats recruit illegals to vote and we need to stop that\n\n2) because the democrats are an existential threat to this country's values from their perspective and need to be stopped at any cost\n\nFrom the perspective of the elites...it's to deny the poor and underprivileged a say. The elites have this thing going on...back from the colonial days, that to keep the heat off themselves they enlist a relatively wealthy but still economically precarious white middle class and pit them against the poor and racial minorities. Keeping infighting between these two groups the ruling class has free reign to do what they want and push their agenda and no one will call them on it because everyone is too busy fighting each other over relatively minor issues. it really is the whole \"say there are 1000 cookies, the rich guy takes 999, gives the middle class guy 1, and then tells him the poor guy wants his cookie\". That's the republicans in a nutshell. \n\nDemocrats arent necessarily much better (i mean they are...but they aren't at the same time) but I'd imagine i'd get blasted on here if i dare criticize them too, but yeah, that's the GOP. That's how I can best explain wtf is going on in their heads. It's a bunch of really smart rich people taking advantage of ignorant masses to push an agenda that benefits them at the expense of the country, while convincing them it's really good for them, and using religion to keep fights on social issues and off of their backs.

{"author":"JonWood007","body":"My own idea:\n\n$1000 a month a person, $333 a month for children ($12k a year, $k for children). Funded with a 45% flat income tax across all incomes, along with spending cuts to some current welfare programs. Social security partially replaced, but not in a way that harms seniors (like imagine you get $2k in social security, now you get $1k and $1k UBI a month), and some military cuts. That flat tax is ALL federal income tax, including what exists as payroll taxes and the like. Corporate tax would also be raised to 45% although this might be unpopular. Capital gains can be lower but i'd still keep things around 30%. \n\nThis sounds insane on paper, but keep in mind UBI acts as a giant tax refund in practice. Say you make $30k a year and are single. You woudl pay in $13,500 and get back $12,000. Your total federal tax burden is $1500 a year. And that's payroll and income tax. \n\nThis would generally speaking be very progressive on low and middle income families. Low income families would see their income go up, middle class families likely wont see a big impact either way but might see their net tax burden go down. The issue is this really hammers high income people. If you're a millionaire you're paying in $450,000 on $1m and then getting back the same $12k as the poor guy does. So rich people will pay.\n\nGenerally speaking, it would mirror milton friedman's negative income tax in a way. Alternatively you could make it an NIT but I think this would allow bureaucracy to add institutional barriers to deny people benefits while I think it should be an unconditional right. 45% marginal tax seems high but would likely be less than the current system which punishes people for finding work and creating welfare cliffs with effective marginal tax rates near 100% so...\n\nNow, my plan does not get rid of medicare and medicaid. I dont think, given the cost of healthcare in america and how hard it wrecks people, that it is wise to undo these programs. So I keep healthcare spending the same. I partially replace social security in the way i described above. \n\nOther possible funding sources would be a land value tax or sales tax. LVT could be a small minor funding function. This would discourage concentration of land ownership and would likely help solve the inflation problems in terms of rent going up in response to UBI by encouraging more market competition. I dont wanna rely on this too heavily since it could throw people out of their homes if their land is deemed too valuable and the tax too high. Still, would be a possible source of revenue in moderation. \n\nA sales tax or VAT is tricky, you add a tax, you reduce the purchasing power of money, you reduce the purchasing power of money, and you make the UBI worth less. And you also hurt middle and high income families too that way. So I kinda see that as a no go but wouldnt be bad in moderation either.\n\nThere's tons of ways of funding it, this is just the approach I came up with. \n\n&gt;Would it be money that could only be spent on such items (whichever we agree is necessary) in the same way as food stamps? Or would it be more you get a check every week and spend it however you see fit? \n\nHowever you see fit. UBI is about flexibility and freedom, not big govrnment telling people how they should live. Also works well since it would be integrated into the tax system in my own idea for it and even middle and upper class families would get it.\n\n&gt;Would there be an opt out or transfer option? Like if someone who\u2019s sole or primary source of income was UBI decides they\u2019d rather live in a better house or better neighborhood than have healthcare would they be allowed to do that?\n\nNo. THis is another reason I like the transfers being MONEY. Let the user decide. if they waste it that's on them. \n\n&gt;And should it vary depending on where you live, and if so how micro should we go?\n\nI dont know how well this could be implemented and might be problematic. I'd rather keep it at the same amount and have people move where affordable. Living in NYC or SF with their $3k a month rents should be a luxury IMO, not a right, we're a huge country.

Fallon made one, Silverman made one, I don't personally think Kimmel made a misstep as the joke was in line with the rest of the show, it was the entire show that was a misstep but that's my personal opinion. \n\nHere's something a lot of people don't realize about comedy, it's not an accurate representation of the true thoughts and feelings of an individual comedian and its rarely true. It is entertainment and no one, not even comedians have that much funny stuff happen to them on a constant basis.

{"author":"SoMuchForSubtleties","body":"(Putting TLDR at top because this post is really fcking long): Liberals are a broad group who support liberty and equality for all. Social Liberals\/Democrats want many things, but some of my and the party's top priority's are election reform, education, healthcare, and reducing poverty. It also is moderately interventionist and supports free trade, but recognizes the issues caused by both.\n\nLiberalism is a ***broad*** ideology that strives to achieve liberty and equality for all. Different branches of liberalism have formed based on different ideas of what those words mean and what the best way to reach them is; however, they all have in common elements such as limited government, constitutional democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc. Believe it or not, at least until the rise of Trump's brand of populism, both major parties in the United States have been liberal (some may argue that Trump's Republican party is still considered liberal; however, I would argue that Trump and the base are best described as Authoritarian\/Reactionary populism). In addition, liberalism was left as the dominant ideology in the world writ large after the collapse of the Soviet Union. \n\nNow, to address the branch of liberalism I suspect you are referring to in your post, is dominant in this subreddit, and is the ideology of the majority of Democrats: social liberalism. Social liberals are unique from the other main strands of liberalism in that they believe that factors such as health, education, economic security, etc. are essential for true liberty and equality (especially equality of opportunity) *and* that the government has the capacity to serve as a powerful tool towards achieving said liberty and equality. It should be noted however that social liberals still believe in limited government, as they do not support government stepping outside the bounds of the necessary. I.E. the government has no business decided who can love who, or seizing control of a company\/setting quotas\/etc. \n\nTo give some specific policy goals of the democratic party, I would first recommend you examine the party's platform now (a better deal) and it's platform in 2016. I would then recommend you look at the stated positions of those seemingly in hunt for the nomination in 2020 (Sanders, Harris, Biden) or other prominent democratic leaders\/followers (Obama, Buffett, Abrams) to get an idea of the range of policies supported. Keep in mind that liberals and the democratic party are made up of people at various points in a spectrum that ranges from the centrist third way democrats, to the centre-left social liberalism, to the leftist social democrats (originated from socialism and arrives at it's policies from a socialism-based mindset but it's policies are capitalist\/liberal and could be arrived at from a social liberal mindset as well). That being said, I'll give you some of my top goals and tell you how much the party as a whole also supports them:\n\n* Broad-reform to the voting system, including but not limited to: abolishing or [circumventing](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) the electoral college, abandoning FPTP voting for better systems such as ranked choice, and the abolition of gerrymandering (establishing non-partisan redistricting commissions is my favorite solution). Each individual idea has varying levels of support, but electoral college and gerrymandering abolition have broad support among the base and the leaders.\n\n* The expansion of healthcare to the entirety of the populace. I don't care how this is accomplished so long as it is universal and affordable; however, it appears by far that government action is incredibly necessary (due to removing the profit motive\/the ability to negotiate with companies with the weight of 320 million people rather than a single person) to achieve these goals, be it through truly single-payer healthcare such as Canada or mixed systems such as Germany's. The party, leadership and base, seems to agree with me on this, with more support among the base for single-payer specifically than among the leadership. \n\n* Reforming the education system. The education system is incredibly broken in the U.S. As a nation, we were ranked as the top nation in both high school and college education in the world. Now, we are ranked between 20th and 30th depending on the subject for high school, and, while the best colleges are still in the United States, the price to attend them is ballooning at an ever-increasing rate, burdening those who wish to stay competitive in an increasingly educated workforce to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, if not hundreds of thousands. As such, there is much to be done. For college, the solution is simple: public colleges should be free to attend, while those wishing to attend a private university should be given the equivalent amount as their education at a public university would cost the government towards tuition (essentially's Sweden's voucher system). For high school, things get tricky. The changes most likely to succeed imo would be to end private schools and federalize public schools in order to ensure quality of education regardless of area and keep the wealthy and powerful invested in the system. Essentially, Finland's model is the most likely to succeed. However, this is obscenely politically unfeasible and involves an uncomfortable amount of choice being restricted for my taste. As such, I support public school funds being separated from local property taxes and instead moved to at least state income taxes. I also support providing free pre-school\/daycare to lower class citizens (or all citizens preferably, but either is acceptable if politically feasible) as early early education\/family environment has been shown to be one of, if not the most important factors for a child's future success educationally. I would say there is a real desire for change in education within the party and base but no clear policy prescriptions have attracted major support. \n\n* This is going to be my last one because of the ridiculous length this post is getting too, but establishing an acceptable economic floor and reviving economic mobility\/the American Dream. I'm not going to get too in-depth about this as it is the result of many many policies such as all of those mentioned above, but there are two notable things that need to be addressed. The government must ensure that there is a safety net in place. Tools such as welfare, food stamps, possibly UBI, are the way to do this, but they should likely be expanded and there should be a more gradual drop-off as income increases to avoid disincentiving working. In order to promote economic mobility, unions must be supported rather than discouraged, and the government must take care that the free market does not become dominated by unnatural monopolies (natural monopolies are acceptable on a case-to-case basis). I would say these ideas have relatively strong support from the leadership and base, but are hard to communicate because the problems today come from the differences in degrees that the programs should be implemented. Who's going to say in an add that Democrats usually break up a monopoly when it gets to 1400 (I think) on the Herfindal Index but Republicans usually wait till it gets to 1700 on it.\n\n* In regards to the problems facing the world, I'm going to take that as asking about trade and foreign policy. In general, the party (and I agree) takes a pragmatic interventionist stance when it comes to foreign policy, preferring to work more with allies and being slightly more reluctant to deploy force than Republicans, but quicker to try to provide aid. In regards to trade, the party supports free trade as a whole, with programs to retrain those left behind. There is, of course, a significant pacifist and protectionist wing of the party but they are a minority. \n\nI'm going to stop there, but feel free to ask if you want to hear about a different policy area or want to hear the evidence behind why I\/the party supports some of these policies.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Liberals are a broad group who support liberty and equality for all. Social Liberals\/Democrats want many things, but some of my and the party's top priority's are election reform, education, healthcare, and reducing poverty. It also is moderately interventionist and supports free trade, but recognizes the issues caused by both.\n\n","created_utc":1540807403,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"SoMuchForSubtleties","body":"&gt; Overall to me it seems like a system that sounds good on paper but doesn't take into account the real material conditions of the world \n\nOn the contrary, I would say that social liberalism sounds fairly poor on paper in comparison to Communism. Everyone equal and able to spend the minimum amount of time at work and pursue their passions outside of it? sign me up. \n\nBut here's the thing, ***there will always be classes***. If anyone ever tells you otherwise, they are full of shit. Human nature leads to people to desire power, and every system has a method through which it can be exploited for power. In communist societies, this method is the state. Unfortunately for communism, there is no way to implement itself on a scale larger than maybe a village without having some amount of bureaucracy, at least with current and foreseeable levels of technology. Those who run said bureaucracy\/government will always begin to accumulate power until they form an upper class themselves. This has happened in every country that has attempted communism and socialism thus far, and they have all either collapsed (venezuela\/USSR), transitioned to a mixed economy (china), or stagnated decades behind (Cuba). \n\nOn the other hand, Capitalism takes this inherent human nature into account to create additional wealth. Make it possible for people to gain power and wealth to do so by providing the goods that people want. This competition *will* create more wealth than socialism\/communism by an order of magnitude. Of course this will create inequality, but inequality is only a problem when either or both of two conditions are true: the bottom of the economic spectrum has an unacceptably low standard of living, and if economic mobility is impossible (obviously these two feed into each other). Now, these conditions are obviously true to varying degrees across the world, but they are becoming less true by the day as a result of capitalism and liberalism. Capitalism has lifted billions out of poverty in the last century, created many many times more wealth globally than had ever existed before, and has done so both for the poor and for the rich. The poorest of the U.S. today have more wealth than all but the .00001% (I'm not just talking peasant vs nobility, I'm talking peasant and nobility vs literally just the kings and queens) of the world two or three centuries ago.\n\nIn other words, class should exist because without it, there is no motivation to strive for the creation of products and innovations within the system. This motivation creates enough extra wealth that the bottom floor can easily be higher than the level of equality that would be found in a completely equal society.\n\n\"Stopgaps\" work because they are a constant check on the natural accumulation of wealth at the very top by redistributing some of it (that they will *never* actually miss in terms of quality of life) back to the bottom and middle. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean about stopping austerity? Austerity is a fiscal policy attempting to pay back debts, and has nothing to do with economic conditions aside from the reduction in GDP resulting from the reduction of the amount of money being put through the spending multiplier (which is why it's a huge mistake to pursue the reduction of the debt during a crisis, rather than during time of economic prosperity).\n\nIf you were referring to recessions and depressions that's exactly it, you limit their effects by spending and reducing taxes on the poor and middle classes.

They note that, at the time of the first increase, the growth rate in new workers in Seattle making less than $15 an hour flattened out and was lagging behind the growth rate in new workers making less than $15 outside Seattle\u2019s county. This suggests that the minimum wage had priced some workers out of the labor market, according to the authors.\n\n  &gt;  \u201cFor folks trying to get a job with no prior experience, it might have been worth hiring and training them when the going rate for them was $10 an hour,\u201d Mr. Vigdor speculated, but perhaps not at $13 an hour.\n\n\n\n(The title of that article is misleading too. You have to read after the \"click here to view full article part to see the whole truth)\n\n\nAfter combining both results, the net effect is seen that it overall HURT workers instead of benefitting them .\n\n\n  &gt;  The minimum-wage increases helped people who were already working low-wage jobs, hurt people who weren\u2019t yet working, and had a somewhat negative effect on pay over all.\n\n\nLater in the article however, it is argued that the statistics may be incorrect due to use of improper methods of calculation.\n\n  &gt;  Other researchers were more skeptical. When last year\u2019s study came out, Ben Zipperer, an expert on the minimum wage at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, pointed out that it failed to adequately account for the fact that Seattle\u2019s economy was growing rapidly when the minimum wage increases took effect.\n\n\nBut if that is true , then the initial assessment that long time workers had increased wages is also false or inaccurate.\n \n\nRemember to always use different sources people .

People like power, sure, but there can and are limits to the expression of power. The issue with classes is that they are a state-enforced distribution of power. Under Marxism, classes are defined by the relationship to the means of production, that is how people earn their living. This creates conflicting relationships, with one dominating over the other, the capitalist over the worker in this case. What I don't see is how a non-bureaucratic, democratic republic can devolve into the degeneracy seen in the USSR (the rise of beurocracy in that time came as a result of lack of productive forces and complicated factors). Would you vote for someone to take advantage of you?\n\nAs for capitalism, it creates the same amount of wealth, but distributes it to a single source, the owner of the capital minus wages. Not only does this not counter selfish tendencies in human behavior, it rewards it. \"Greed is good\". Leaving aside the inherent conflicts this creates, there is no explicit reason why capitalism would be more \"productive\" than socialism. Also, your argument about living better than kings could have been said about people living in the USSR, moreso then than now. \n\n&gt;class should exist\n\nWhat I don't get is why you think people wouldn't innovate or create without trying to exploit class relations.
