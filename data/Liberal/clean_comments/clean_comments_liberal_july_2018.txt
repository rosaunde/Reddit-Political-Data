I 100% guarantee that alt-right trolls are going to turn the exact same tactic against Democratic officials, but with much more frequency and viciousness, and claim that their behavior is all excused because Maxine started it first.\n\nSometimes its best to leave the genie in the bottle.","created_utc":1530487714,"score":5,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Kid_Contact","body":"ACTUALLY conservatives align themselves with traditional constitutional values. Conservatives interpret the constitution as written using precedence to back up their decisions. It is liberal justices on the supreme court that believe the constitution is a living breathing document that needs to be constantly changed. This is a big problem because liberal justices believe it is their right to interpret the law the way they want to and not the way it is written. It is important to remember that congress makes the laws not the supreme court. When the supreme court justices decide to take matters into their own hands by ruling with emotion they are meddling with the checks and balances that were put in place by the constitution. So to say that conservatives or \"the right\" has no respect for the constitution you would be very very very wrong. In fact it is the left that has no respect for the constitution. If you were to ask members of the democratic party if they wanted to rewrite the constitution it would be a resounding yes. The right would leave it exactly as is. Remember this country was designed to protect itself from the ignorant masses. That is why we can't just rip up everything every time a new party takes control. If the conservatives have such little respect for the US then why is the right pushing so hard for voter ID laws that make sure ONLY american citizens are voting. You have to be an American citizen to vote and yet somehow asking people to provide identification when they vote is racist. The right wants Americans to vote on American issues.

I've witnessed people on the right saying they believe in capitalism but I've never witnessed anyone admitting they are destroying democracy. \n\nIf equality and justice are essential for democracy, we in the US have moved so far away that I fear we are lost.

{"author":"iratebutisave","body":"I am a liberal and I hate a lot of the liberals out there today.  The advent of the internet has made it easy to find places where like minded people can gather and discuss their ideas.  Unfortunately those are typically relatively protective of their in-group and do not allow for much dissenting opinion.  That means that if the group starts at a 5, very quickly the members will push it to an 8 as members tout more extreme views to get the social reinforcement they crave.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Group_polarization\n\nWe see this on both sides of the aisle.  Why do I hate liberals more than conservatives?  Because most liberals are only socially liberal and use that as a soapbox to denounce any who disagree.  Today liberals are the in-group and their ideas are the dominant ones we see in society, reflected throughout media and everything else.\n\nTim Ferris commented on this in his AMA as one of the primary reasons he is moving away from SF.  Repression of ideas is more abhorrent than any given idea.\n\nLiberals are very guilty of this these days.  Saying \"Trump has some good ideas\" quickly gets you shouted down or labeled a racist.  Saying men's rights activists have some valid points gets you labeled a misogynist.\n\nLook at the other comments in this thread, quick to blame anyone and everything but themselves and the culture they propagate.  Liberals are not some weak victim getting bullied.  It is the dominant narrative today, and what you're seeing is a reaction to both the paradigm shift of the narrative as well as the tyrannical behavior of many liberals who are more intolerant of different ideas than the fascists they claim to fight.","created_utc":1530729685,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

First, I highly doubt you'd have such a laid back opinion if a bunch of anti abortion activists were harassing a pro choice Senator outside their home given how you've characterized your political opponents as emotionless, uncaring, power hungry villains(*They have clearly shown all they care about is power and winning over the past decade*).

The Civil Rights leaders were strategic and the demonstrators highly disciplined in non violent protest. That's because they knew that calling for unorganized angry mobs to form is **dangerous**. Humans, like most animals are highly susceptible to mob mentality. All it takes is one angry person in that angry mob to do something violent and like a contagion that violence could spread to the rest of the crowd.

{"author":"Metric_Head","body":"Sure, thanks for asking. You\u2019re right, it is extreme and it\u2019s possible I made a mistake and will regret it. I was raised liberal and have always voted liberal except for the year Harper was elected. that was my first federal election and I was barely of age to vote. I voted conservative to spite my mother who was voting liberal\u2014it was a very irresponsible move on my part which I regret that stemmed from an argument. I didn\u2019t respect my vote then. \n\nI really liked Trudeau\u2019s campaign and I felt that while the Harper government had done a few good things that benefited me and people I cared about, it was time to toss them out and try something new. Donald Trump was campaigning and I wrote that off as a battle already lost\u2014surely Hillary Clinton would win. And yet, as that election proceeded I became more and more inclined to believe Trump would win. Then he did. \n\nAfter Trump came into power it felt like to volume dial on progressive liberal and socialist rhetoric got turned up to full blast. Men were bad, whites were bad, women needed special help to succeed, masculinity was toxic, gender didn\u2019t exist, and so on. If you didn\u2019t agree with this you were a \u2018Nazi\u2019 and a monster. It was no longer enough to behave in a way that afforded equal dignity and respect to others even if you internally thought poorly of them\u2014the political climate wanted us to change our thoughts. \n\nI was trained as a scientist; suddenly it seemed that respect for facts (like there only being two genders) was gone. Facts were replaced with feelings. Feelings are important, but empiricism is the backbone of logic and logic is what permits us to have a free society. \n\nI started to see people protesting this and that and I would see signs that didn\u2019t make sense \u201cpuberty is choice\u201d was particularly alarming. I was verbally assaulted at a cafe near York University by a transgender individual who took offence to a discussion I was having with a friend about the androgen theory of transgenderism. The transgender movement has been a big reason that pushed me out of the liberal space, despite my personal and clinical  belief in supporting such individuals suffering from Gender Dysphoria. Bill C-16 really scared me, it seemed like an example of one of many new things done with good intentions but that was done at the cost liberty and freedom. \n\nWhen Trudeau spoke poorly of the verdict made in regards to Colton Boushie\u2019s death I saw a complete lack of respect for our legal system, and suspect it was done to pander to the outraged indigenous community. I was waiting in the business lounge at Union Station a few months prior to switching parties and an indigenous family who had been permitted into the lounge after an issue with their tickets got in a fight with the travel rep who was sent to tell them that they needed to find accommodations for the night. The teenaged daughters immediately started threatening the rep. \u201cI\u2019m calling the CBC! You can\u2019t treat natives like this!\u201d When security came to remove them security was unable to act because the security guards were white and they were being filmed by one of the daughters. Everything is about race or gender or creed. We\u2019re not just people anymore. The Liberal party supports this. \n\nThe rants by MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes, again while well intentioned, were alarming and not how I felt time in the House of Commons should be spent. Trudeau splitting the cabinet equally between males and females for no other reason than \u201cits 2015\u201d was devoid of logic and forced a ratio that we were already moving towards organically. While trying to ameliorate a gender gap he made gender a condition of appointment; gender should not play a role in whether you get a position or not. To do this with the cabinet was really unforgivable. \n\nThe liberal budget was the clincher. Don\u2019t allocate money to me because I\u2019m female. It\u2019s insulting. The programs listed were, again, seemingly selected with good intentions but focused so heavily on race and gender and forcing a utopian demographic composition that I was really alarmed. I read it a few times, I considered the rhetoric of feminists in Canada and the kind of double-think that seemed to be creeping into our country under the Liberal government and realized that I was supporting a party that would hate and reject me if they knew what I valued and believed. Liberals hate me, how could I still be one?\n\nI don\u2019t believe in the Liberal policies or what leadership claims to be their priorities. I think we are moving towards real socialism and that we are more divided by our demographic characteristics than ever before. We are more intolerant of one another than ever before in my lifetime. We don\u2019t really love the poor, we just hate the rich, and we\u2019re not supporting a hand up anymore\u2014we\u2019re giving away handouts. I don\u2019t think these are good things. \n\nWhen I started seeing sense in Trump\u2019s statements rather than idiocy I was no longer a liberal. When I would get downvotes into oblivion for sharing a contrasting point of view, I was no longer a liberal. When I got put on the #settlercollector list on twitter, I was no longer a liberal. When the kids came home with the genderbread person and a homework assignment that required them to write about their white privilege, I was no longer a liberal. When I was attacked for being a lesbian that won\u2019t date a transgender MtF woman, I was no longer a liberal. \n\n Andrew Scheer\u2019s statements seem good and reasonable to me, as do those of the Conservative party (for the most part). So I switched to the party that I felt had the stronger leadership. And yes, I voted for the rep in my area that led to Doug Ford being elected. I\u2019ve just had enough of outrage and antifa and forced \u2018equality\u2019 and everything else associated with the Liberal Party of Canada itself and Liberals in general right now. I\u2019m not alone either.  Enough already. ","created_utc":1530833486,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Trump was the better of two evils and is raising our country\u2019s military, economy and notoriety in the world which is all things Obama attempted to lower, however Obama did setup many ways for the disabled and needy of USA to get a leg up.

This country was founded Christian however Thomas Jefferson was right there should be a separation of church and state. Never implemented in the constitution but it should be. Equal opportunity for all\n\n16.  If you are referring to the shooting. The guy didn\u2019t do it for a political agenda. He disliked a judge and had a criminal record. The fbi was watching him yet did nothing again. We should have tighter policies on that\n\nAlso who said we want violence tweeds journalists?? They just do there jobs. The people who are the ones that need talking to are the people who throw money at political leaders to keep their network alive. On both sides of the political compass.\n\n17. Seeing how we were one vote away from getting rid of free speech we need him. Also freedom of religion. ONE VOTE AWAY\n\nFun fact: the Supreme Court is a democracy not republic and it has the ability I alter the constitution. A perfect democracy is fascism and that\u2019s scary.

There are [actual Nazis](https:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/20000-illinois-republicans-voted-for-nazi-7bbeeb7631fd\/) running for office in the GOP, and the President says they are \"fine people.\"  It seems very clear to me that the GOP feels they have found a golden ticket to be as racist as they can and get away with it by crying for \"civility\" and an end to \"name-calling\" as soon as someone observes that racism and bigotry are infesting the whole party and the basis behind most of its policies.  If you want to have an adult conversation, you have to address the racist elephant in the room instead of waving it off and expecting people to ignore it because it is indefensible.  The first step is admitting you have a problem.  The GOP has a big racism problem.  Until you are ready to acknowledge and discuss that, I don't see any adult conversation being possible.

{"author":"Zelk","body":"Nicely done! Sorry I just woke up. \n\nKind of raises a number of questions really, I think the biggest one being, to you, what is a liberal and what is a conservative? The technical, and historical term appears different than what the bodies of people are in today's landscape. Liberals want science, personal freedom, affordable healthcare, confederate statues to be brought down, anti Nazi... Conservitives constantly seem ardently opposite to liberals. I don't see Nazi's voting for Hillary or Bernie any time soon, or the KKK, and conservatives are the side that defend the confederacy. What was yesterdays names as liberal and conservative, certainly isn't today.\n\n1. I understand a lot of countries in the U.N. were not putting in as much in defense spending as they were supposed to (I think 3% GDP? Right?) Getting countries to help with the cost makes sense. Stability is expensive. \n\nI need to learn about Jerusalem and that whole ordeal, constitutionally not recognizing a religion makes a lot of the problems we have in parts of the world less about less about political tribs and more about human welfare. That's totally speaking from my opinion though. \n\n2. The prediction thing is what got me out of conservative media, I noticed a trend in repeating a lot of stuff like WW3, Nuclear War, California collapsing to basically have a survivalist mindset and fear all the time. Often it felt like anything was being said all the time and anything that would stick, was hounded on constantly until the next thing. It was liberals who made USB to replace all connectors for phones, funded and founded the internet, pushed for renewable tech that could have made America the leader in renewable energy manufacturing but conservatives made damn sure it wasn't going to be us. So now that's China. \n\nIt's weird to me that the only place conservatives seem to think exists that's liberal is Detroit. My understanding is that it was designed around lots of industry that just wasn't fruitful. It doesn't matter if the government is liberal or conservative, no resources means failure. What about New York? Seattle? LA? When we look at the GDP in the states, half the voting population voted blue, and 66% of the GDP voted blue...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/the-avenue\/2016\/11\/29\/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america\/\n\n\nQuestion is, yeah Detroit is bad, but what is a red city that shows off conservative values well?\n\n3. Good to know :) \n\n4. What do people need? I'm not a doctor and I feel like we should pay and equip doctors to make those decisions, not profit first shareholder second insurance companies. I want people to function in society and be productive, what works for me may not work for others and vice versa. DO you have any thoughts on how to fix insurance based care?\n\n5. Cool. \n\n6. The wedding cake deal was dumb. But this really expresses the Christian first and foremost over the Constitution though i see with conservatives. Mind you any ruling that says a Christian view, law or belief should be upheld and administered to the general public, will compete against other religions, Islamic included. Personally I have gone from being a devout Christian to anti religion everything in my life. I know I'm exteme in this, and it bothers me, I see it doing more harm than good.\n\n7. I'm a bit confused in your response here, if we're talking about healthcare we already pay more per GDP though taxes in healthcare than other countries, AND we have to pay insurance companies just for existing, it seems like we're getting the bad end of the deal here. But what about the other things like early voting, education funding and peer review? Other countries seem to do it well but for some reason we seem to make it more expensive than it needs to be.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.latimes.com\/nation\/la-na-healthcare-comparison-20170715-htmlstory.html\n\n\n8. https:\/\/hbr.org\/2010\/04\/what-the-founding-fathers-real.html\n\nOur founding fathers certainly didn't seem to think companies were people, currently insurance companies and housing businesses seem to be taking Americans for all their worth. Trump and Conservatives seem to want to replace everything with a business mentality. I was in the service during Bush and the culture shift was staggering. Replacing personnel with contractors and constantly cutting corners led to a lot of problems that shouldn't have existed, from reduced redundancy, backups, effective tools, training and readiness to do our job. The business mindset is constantly \"Trim the fat\" when in reality it was gut and sell. I believe corporate is good for some practices like entertainment and luxury, but I've grown hostile against corporate mindset in everything.\n\n9. Awesome, why do you think \"Taxation is theft\" is a thing? Why not? If you could restructure taxes, what would you do? My answer would be no taxes on people making just above a fair wage then tax higher income earners proportionally to the deficit. I would prefer everyone be capable of paying into taxes, but with automation and capital pooling, it seems like wages just aren't rising enough for a basic living. (Personal space and enough to grow, save and invest, not stagnate or live paycheck to paycheck)\n\n10. But why are conservatives the side with Hitler, KKK and Confederates? Why don't we see more Conservatives voice against these groups?\n\n\n11. Cool. Personally I think everyone should be trained to handle first response. \n\n\n12. I used to think that. Now I'm struggling to find any kind of valid stance the right have that doesn't involve bashing the left.\n\n\n13. I haven't. I have noticed the investigation is having more success than conservatives have had against liberals though like Hillary's emails (What about Bush's?) Benghazi etc.\n\n\n14. Sorry, Shepard Smith on Fox. A lot of Conservatives seem to hate him. \n\n\n\nGood answers, :) And I think that covers a lot of questions people would have. I like the Constitution in a lot of ways, the 1st Amendments freedom from religion and allowance to personally be religious I think is brilliant because it means if you want anything done, it has to be tested and not an opinion. Just because religious text says it, doesn't mean we should all do it. Vaccinations has a huge effect on the population, forcing men to be circumcised... is less so. Doing research trying to validate conservative ideals vs liberal ones has gotten me where I am today, it started with comparing the effect of studying the Bible vs studying science, which seems to mirror Conservatives vs LIberal, at least to me. \n","created_utc":1530900465,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"glimpee","body":"Ok so Ill preface by saying this is a topic I dont know much about, but ill at least say my ideals.\n\nFor me, best is what has the greatest overall impact on social\/economic growth as well as overall happiness and chance for fulfillment in life. Anything outside of saying that might get too abstract and personal\n\nI think the best part is that every one does have a chance to make their own market, to share their idea, and to gain profit by benefiting the masses.\n\nOne of the biggest issues of this is that people who face socio-economic disparity have less of a chance of doing so, and people who have money are more likely to be able to play the system. The hard part is that there is no community in the world yet that treats every person as equal, even communist communities (and they tend to put everyone lower than the average in many capitalist countries.) Now, thats hard because what I define as good is best for the overall. We cannot yet have a system where everyone does have equal opportunity, and I think thats a damn shame and something we should work for, but thats a different discussion entirely. Either way, there are plenty of cases of people who come from the bottom who work their way to the top, although I will agree it is not fair that they have to work harder.. but that is just kinda how reality works, throughout history and the world. Although again, I think its something we should all work to change.\n\nNow, I dont believe in a completely free market. I dont believe monopolies should be allowed. I dont believe companies should have free reign in disposing waste. \n\nBut I do believe that people with good products should make more money. Think about the computer you have, the car you drive, the house you own, the clothes you wear, the food you eat. All of those things were made by the 1&amp;#37;. I think they SHOULD have more money, because they succeeded in making products that appeals to masses. They have earned it. \n\nIn a perfect world, the more money those people make, the more people they hire, and the better job everyone does, the more money they make.\n\nBut I will agree there is a huge issue with outsourcing basically slave labor to other countries and underpaying workers to do a job they are overqualified for.\n\nBut I think that issue is more of a social one. We as a people dont value those who work for us enough, we have hugely lost a sense of community and comradary, and we see money and abundance as something to be hoarded. I dont think thats fulfilling to humans.\n\nAt the same time, I think over the past few hundred years we have made leaps and bounds. I think we've developed more as an industry than we have as a people, and I think thats the biggest issue. \n\nSo under what conditions does it work best? I think it works best when everyone has equal footing, when everyone is reaching for fulfillment, and when everyone cares as deeply for their neighbors as they do their family. Sadly, this isnt true, and perhaps never will be. For the foreseeable future, there will always be suffering, and there will always be an imbalance.\n\nThat said, the documentary, I think its called \"Happy\" or \"Be Happy\" demonstrates that people in the worst conditions in the world can still find happiness and fulfillment, and I think thats the most important thing of all.","created_utc":1530926126,"score":4,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Yes, free health care also takes care of people who cannot afford health care, but it ends up costing everyone anyways and the average patient often has to wait extremely long times, to the point where their disease or problem no longer becomes treatable. They still have the option for paid healthcare, but only at prices the most wealthy could afford. \n\nWe already pay for those who cannot afford healthcare. Hospitals cannot turn someone down, and the costs move to us anyways. What we get out of it is better healthcare, better doctors, and faster treatment.\n\nWhen the economy is doing well, I think we should see trickle down effects. Help the impoverished get out of poverty, better funded schools and social systems, improving quality of life across the board, helping the most in need first.\n\nWhen the economy is not doing well, I think we need to focus on the fundamentals. Keeping as many people as possible alive and save. That becomes a sliding scale of how to help the most people as much as possible, and where that lands is subjective and I dont know enough to make a claim.

They can help them navigate difficult situations, teach them to stand up for themselves, help them pick classes, and teach them they are due what they work for. Do you know the #1 reason poor kids drop out of college? They don't seek help because all their lives, our society teaches them they don't deserve anything. They are taught by our society that they don't belong and don't deserve anything.  Where I live, there are local elementary schools where 30% or more of the kids don't eat over the weekend because despite working two jobs, their parents still can't afford to put food on the table. The parents have no time to help them with school work or even supervise them in any meaningful way. The kids show up Monday practically starving and are expected to sit in class and learn shit. How is giving money to schools going to help that?\n\nAnd don't play the \"government business\" game. Private schools have been defrauding governments for years and it's getting worse.

Support is the issue.\n\nI agree with this statement, but not quite your whole argument. Perhaps government business was the wrong thing to say on my part.\n\nLet me try to give a view from a friend who comes from an impoverished community, though. He says kids there didnt want to work hard because they had teachers who didnt really care because they were the bottom rung of teachers who didnt get hired into top schools and make more money. Teachers who wernt happy where they were, and who didnt make learning something kids could strive for.\n\nSo I bring that up because me saying money was the issue was oversimplifying it. In the school, money and resources facilitate more support, and support really is the end game.

I mean, I hope we reach Star Trek level society, but I do think the rich have a right to be rich and what comes with it.\n\nFor the kids who are starving, I think thats where our resources should go for a big part.

I do encourage you to continue this part of the discussion especially.\n\nSo what is affirmative action? One idea is that its \"a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group\"\n\nThe goal is to get people who have been historically discriminated against a place to succeed, to fight discrimination.\n\nThis means slots are reserved for races that are underrepresented. Schools have a finite number of slots available, so that takes a chunk out of potential slots for anyone else.\n\nAt that point, do you disagree?\n\nIf not, that means if the white quota is full and the black quota isnt, a white person doesnt get a slot, even if they are more qualified than a black person, who is being using to fill the quota.\n\nI consider that racist. That is using a persons skin color as a determining factor. There are tons of cases of this in the US.\n\nNow, I want to say, I think affirmative action is a good SHORT TERM solution. It helps level the playing field and helps discriminated races get back up to the middle ground where then later on equal opportunity becomes much more possible for the whole.\n\nThat said, I see nothing else happening to promote equal opportunity, and to me it looks like affirmative action is seen as the end all solution. This, I think, is misguided and leads to plenty of other issues.\n\nI know you might still see this as bullshit, but I do not. I would really like to know how it is bullshit, and not just an opinion based off right with propaganda\n\nTo end, I think 1 to 5 is much better than 1 to 100, of COURSE. But thats not how this works, and thats disingenuous. I would LOVE to see equal outcome, but I would distain seeing it made by a PR stunt to equalize race just for the sake of looking racially equal. Thats what we call having a \"token black kid\" on a TV show, and its no better in schools.\n\nI think everyone should be based on their merit, and discriminated races having as much opportunity to reach the same level of merit.\n\n&gt;You're right. White males get all the breaks. How do we fix that?\n\nHow do we fix that? Give everyone else the breaks.\n\nThat said, I think white males also do face a new form of challenge, although its not comparable to others.\n\nWe arent allowed to be part of many social discussions because they \"dont understand, they are while males.\" I think that in itself speak volumes to a push back against oppressors, who at this point (young people) were never part of oppression. Again, thats not comparable to what others have gone through in history, but I think its majorly been equalized quite a bit. I dont think there is institutional racism, but I think there is socio-economic disparity.\n\nI think white males have perpetrated a lot in history of the US, but now theres a push back on modern while males. Ive been told its my turn to shut up and let others take the lead, simply because Im a white male. Other white males ive talked to felt they cant say anything because of white guilt. These are some of the nicest and most respectful people I know, and they simply dont want to overstep their bounds cuz their ancestors did things that we now consider terrible, and they were terrible. That said, thats only one topic on how white males dont receive absolute privilege\n\nso again, my solution is to help everyone get \"all the breaks.\"\n\nhope I discussed everything youve mentioned, let me know if Ive missed anything\n\nedit: forgot to respond to this \n\n&gt; What's worse, someone who doesn't need extra help getting it, or someone who needs extra help *not* getting it? \n\nIm not sure I understand this...

What do you mean by getting it, might be the question I should ask\n\nNo, for welfare (which I assume is what you were talking about). Is it better to let a moocher slip through who is abusing the system if it means someone who needs the help gets it or is it better to deny someone who needs it if it means fewer people abusing the system? You'll never get 100% accuracy on this and no matter what you do, some will get away with abusing the system and some will get left behind. Where do you put that decision point?  Preventing abuse and abandoning worthy people, or allowing abuse and helping more worthy people? Where you draw that line pretty much determines whether you're more liberal or more conservative. See, the conservative is more worried about what the rule says and the progressive is more worried about doing what they feel is right. The abuse bothers a conservative much more than a liberal. It doesn't mean we don't care, it just means we're willing to sacrifice it to help more of the worthy people.\n\nI'll break up responses to the rest tomorrow.

{"author":"Donnot","body":"&gt;\tBut the silence thing is a huge issue on both sides. People who are liberally who disagree with just some extreme ideas, at least in my state art school 18-22 year old community, are instantly attacked. No one here feels they can say anything that hasnt been deemed \"politically incorrect\" by extremist liberals. Maybe liberal is wrong, as they seem more like socialists. The issue is, the extreme left seems a lot more vocal and heard than the extreme right, to me. Even more than the moderate left.\n\nI respectfully disagree with this, especially in regards to social media more-so than in my \"real life\". First off, I don't like to watch conservative media because as soon as I watch the first few minutes I'm instantly offended by their off-putting biases and what I call half-truths in regards to their facts. The comment sections of conservative media obviously replicates the video\/reporting of right-wing media with very little liberal argument. Compare this to liberal media with a comment section entirely full of al-right wing extremists flooding and \"ganging\" up on liberals. A perfect example of this is the comment section of CNN. \n\nIn my real life, when I come across an obvious conservative, they will typically keep their political ideas to themselves because it is obvious that I am liberal. In this sense we'll typically be cordial if politics aren't involved. My brother used to be influenced by conservative ideals because of the job he held at the time and he'd come home with these ridiculous arguments that we disputed for hours on- it was hilarious. \n\nIn my life I've had occasional instances of the right-wing extremist blurt out derogatory and discriminatory epithets at me, similar to what we see in a social media comment section. Whether it be at my job, school or simply going to a fast food restaurant to get something to eat.\n\nIn any case, the extreme right, most definitely is heard very loud and clear and in a very disrespectful manner.  I've never had any sort of issues with a left-wing extremist, I'm not sure if this is because I am liberal, in other words, it could be socially motivated where a left-wing extremist would blurt out epithets to a conservative and a right-wing extremist blurt out epithets at a liberal in different circumstances where one is strongly vocal about something that they don't like in the other person based upon their ideology.\n\nWhere I stand on a balanced neutral line is religion. I believe in the freedom of religion which then causes a lot of problems. I believe in 100% LGBTQ rights including marriage, as I equally believe in rights to Christians. So when I see anti-Christian liberals go at conservatives for their religious beliefs I don't like that just like I don't like to see conservatives reject making a wedding cake to a gay couple because of their religious beliefs. In the last case, LGBTQ are legally entitled to get married and they have the right to have a wedding cake made anywhere no matter if your religious beliefs are that you can not except same sex marriage because the law now states that LGBTQ can be legally married. Atheists deserve to believe in their beliefs, Muslims, ect. Because of this there then comes a clash. And this is probably where I am in a more neutral ground than I think most liberals or conservatives. I'm probably more progressive rather than centrist\/centralist in this respect, from what I've read up on because conservatives typically will base belief systems on Christianity and I would base it on law of equality which is what I believe America is attempting to fall under.","created_utc":1530956380,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Kerplonk","body":"I used the word harassment to mimic the term you used in the previous comment because I thought it sounded good rhetorically to do so.  It is clearly part of the job for them to face criticism and labeling that criticism harassment is just a means to paint my previous comment uncharitably.  A right to speech dependent upon that speech being easily ignored is not much of a right at all.  \n\n\nSo I looked it up and apparently I have been using \"more power to them\" incorrectly, though I'm not sure if that's what you are pointing out.  It seems it implies wishing someone successful in their endeavors.  I have always used it more as \"I don't think that is a valuable goal to pursue but If you want to waste your time have at it.\"  That being said, while I would not be cheering people on for protesting a Senator outside their home I honestly think that is a better situation than the current practice of protesting doctors and patients outside medical facilities; a situation I find crass but am not exactly losing any sleep over.  \n\n\n\\&gt; you've characterized your political opponents as emotionless, uncaring, power hungry villains  (*They have clearly shown all they care about is power and winning over the past decade*)   \n\n\nIt would be fair to say I called them power hungry but not emotionless, uncaring, or villains.  The important portion of that statement is the right is by no means being constrained due to the left taking the high road on any issue.  If they believe a strategy will help them achieve their goals they will pursue it regardless of what those on the left do.  We shouldn't engage in behavior that we don't think should be engaged in on the merits, but we shouldn't pretend the right is holding back out of a sense of fair play.  \n\n\n\\&gt;  Second, do you honestly think it's for the good of the country if protesting and yelling at people outside their homes becomes the standard for how we engage with political opponents?  \n\n\nDo you not find the separation of children from their parents especially galling?  What I honestly believe is that people have the ability to respond proportionally to the actions of their government and the idea that there should be some limit on their response regardless of the activities the government is engaging in because otherwise the limits will disappear completely is misanthropic.  \n\n\n \\&gt;Right but the **type** of blowback matters. The ends do not justify the means   \n\n\nSo those statements have opposite meanings.  The first suggests that this strategy is not the best way to achieve our policy goals.  I will readily admit that is possible and a very valid criticism that should not be dismissed.  If such tactics are counter productive in the long run they should be abandoned.  The second statement suggests that even if we knew for certain this strategy would get us exactly what we wanted we would not be justified in engaging in such tactics.  I think that is patently false.  On the one hand we have a few of the most privileged individuals in the world being moderately inconvenienced  because they are perpetrating what is widely seen as abhorrent behavior, on the other we have thousands of families literally being ripped apart by those policies.  I don't see how you can say the latter doesn't justify the former if you knew the end result would go in your favor.  \n\n\n\\&gt;The Civil Rights leaders were strategic and the demonstrators highly disciplined in non violent protest. \n\nI'm always a little suspicious of these arguments.  They can be made in good faith, but often the seem to end up being an attempt to set the bar so high for any sort of action that that it becomes an insurmountable barrier.","created_utc":1530960543,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Mine is heavily left, and I dont know a single person who is centrist, let alone conservative. \n\nCould you link me to a comment section on CNN youre talking about? I havent heard of this and would like to know more... especially because I feel the term \"alt-right\" is thrown around pretty easily \n\n&gt; In my real life, when I come across an obvious conservative, they will typically keep their political ideas to themselves because it is obvious that I am liberal. In this sense we'll typically be cordial if politics aren't involved. My brother used to be influenced by conservative ideals because of the job he held at the time and he'd come home with these ridiculous arguments that we disputed for hours on- it was hilarious. \n\nWell I think the fact that two people who believe differently dont just start fighting and pushing ideas on each other is great! I try to hold out of political discussion until one starts around me and I say \"hold on, I dont agree with that\" and try to keep it as civil, calm, and fact based as possible. I also know people CAN be totally influence by ridiculous ideals on both sides, and it can be pretty hilarious \n\n&gt; In my life I've had occasional instances of the right-wing extremist blurt out derogatory and discriminatory epithets at me, similar to what we see in a social media comment section. \n\nThats absolutely abhorrent and I'm sorry that happened. I also hope that you dont box the rest of the right in with the extremists. White supremacists are only really found in the far right, because I will concede, the rights ideals seems more welcoming to white supremacists, and that sucks cuz it gives up all a bad name. But extreme leftists have a lot of hate too (I see it constantly where I'm at) and it gives the left a bad name as well, though not quite as bad as white supremacists.\n\n&gt; in any case, the extreme right, most definitely is heard very loud and clear and in a very disrespectful manner. \n\nHeard, but not catered to. No one is censoring TV because the extreme right doesnt want to see a black person in a major role. No one is kicking liberals out of comedy clubs. No one is getting fired for being liberal. The inverse is true.\n\n&gt;  I've never had any sort of issues with a left-wing extremist, I'm not sure if this is because I am liberal, in other words, it could be socially motivated where a left-wing extremist would blurt out epithets to a conservative and a right-wing extremist blurt out epithets at a liberal in different circumstances where one is strongly vocal about something that they don't like in the other person based upon their ideology. \n\nYes it is definitely because youre liberal. You have \"right thoughts.\" No liberal will attack you because youre in line with their code of conduct and thoughts. That idea is terrifying to me. They attack sponsors of entertainers, comedy clubs, teachers, students, bosses, and employees if they say things that are considered \"hate speech\" for example, which really anyone can define as anything. Saying there isnt enough science on transgender yet to know how it works and so its premature to make laws that compel speech and behavior is seen at hate speech by many, and people have lost their jobs or gotten kicked out of school for saying such things. Compelled speech and behavior is what the extreme left pushes for, and theyre not pushing it on you because youre already doing what they want\n\n&gt; Where I stand on a balanced neutral line is religion. I believe in the freedom of religion which then causes a lot of problems. I believe in 100&amp;#37; LGBTQ rights including marriage, as I equally believe in rights to Christians. \n\nAwesome! We agree. I'm glad the laws seem to reflect this so far\n\n&gt; So when I see anti-Christian liberals go at conservatives for their religious beliefs I don't like that just like I don't like to see conservatives reject making a wedding cake to a gay couple because of their religious beliefs. \n\nBoth of those instances are really quite silly. That said, if we are allowed to fire people for saying the wrong thing (and having it not be against the 1st amendment) I do think people should have the RIGHT to say\/do what many will see as wrong. Again, making those people make the wedding cake that goes against their beliefs is compelled behavior, and I dont think thats a good thing. It puts those people in a very very uncomfortable position and forces them to do something they really dont want to do. I agree its terrible that they have those views, but I think thats their right.\n\nThat said, I think if there are NO places that will sell them a wedding cake, we have a totally different problem on our hands.\n\nAnd that said, I dont think its a human right to have a wedding cake. It is a human right to have religious beliefs. If a christian says \"it goes against everything I believe to my core to make this cake, I wish to respectfully decline\" I think he should be allowed to\n\n&gt; conservatives typically will base belief systems on Christianity and I would base it on law of equality which is what I believe America is attempting to fall under. \n\nAny conservative who bases their argument off the law of God I will respectfully tell to shut their mouths. I have only even nodded my head to conservatives who actually speak from a factual basis that actually supports equality as well. But my argument about cake is what I would call freedom, and equality of freedom. Making that person make a cake takes away their freedom to choose. Not allowing that cake in that one bakery takes away much much less from the gay couple.

{"author":"glimpee","body":"Well I think a lot of it has to do with a group mentality and the media thats available. CNN, MSNBC, and most major networks are left leaning, talking about mass shooting, cops killing black people, etc etc etc. These are very emotionally charged arguments and very convincing. They reach the deep empathy of many people, and without doing some research (like finding out white are proportionally killed more than blacks by cops.) Back that up with the fact that Fox has a terrible reputation, and most people dont consider it a valid news source, everything people see will be left leaning.\n\nSo once that emotional ideology takes root, and having everyone around you support it - including your teachers who are supposed to be an authority on knowledge, it becomes very hard to think otherwise. Further, one of the hardest things for a person to do is to admit they are wrong and to change their beliefs. I luckily LOVE doing that, so once  I had the curiosity and knowledge that I hadnt heard the other side, I started exploring and my mind was blown by all the stats ive never heard before. \n\nBut then when you have that hard rooted group mentality, once that condemns hate speech and attacks anything \"other\" as bigoted and leading to a new holocaust, people get upset and protest that \"other\" way of thinking. Since these people are so loud and have a morally reasonable argument, the media listens, and becomes more left leaning, spewing more left leaning agendas, and leaving out any other facts for fear that they might be seen as hateful and have a riot on their hands.\n\nThis becomes a viscous cycle. Either youre part of that cycle, or you break out of it. I did, and realized BOTH sides have major issues. Thats not the only way to break out, but its the way I went.\n\nReally it comes down to pretty basic psychology and sociology  \n\n\nBut yeah I mainly made this post because I cannot find a single left leaning speaking, debater, or news source that doesnt cherry pick information and make an emotional argument over a factual one.

{"author":"RealSpaceEngineer","body":"Well first off, it wouldn't be half, assuming we are talking specifically about the proposal. It would be half after a certain income level is reached. For example, let's assume we create a new 50% tax bracket at $1 million a year. That means a person making $1.5 million a year in *net* income (which is what they take home after \"business\" expenses, not to be confused with gross income we are accustomed to) they will pay $585,689 in taxes, with an effective tax rate of 39.04%. That is still fairly steep, but it is not 50%.\n\nSecond, there is rationale behind taxing the rich at higher rates. It was the prosperity of the country, the roads you drove when not quite so rich, the amenities you enjoy and those that your fellow citizens enjoyed that granted you the opportunity to make a fancy invention, or have the liberty to become a famous actor in the first place. Without those emities paid for by the government with other, richer, folk's money, you could have never achieved what you have now. You can argue you would have any ways, but I'd argue try being a famous actor making a fortune in the medieval era. It simply would not be possible due to greater societal problems that didn't allow for the masses to enjoy such leisure. \n\nSo now that you are rich, you are expected to pay it forward for the betterment of all, as other wealthy folk did for you, without you taking a moment to contemplate it. Sure, everyone is not entitled to your success. You worked very hard to get there, and there is no doubt of that. But Bill Gates couldn't have built Microsoft without standing on the shoulders of giants going back thousands of years. \n\nEvery person has a debt to society, but not every person has the ability to pay that debt, so others must bare it. Debts to society were originally just payments for protection. To build the city walls, to man the guard post at night, to fight a shed blood for your protection. But as society developed, so did it's role. Those traditional roles remain, but they have added new ones that provide intrinsic value to every member of society for the purpose of progress. In addition to figurative walls, now there are financial safety nets. Now there is long term stability and infrastructure to facilitate long-distance commerce, which enables greater individual specialization, and in turn higher productivity and value for all, including those who are already rich.\n\nThat brings up another point that money makes more money by affording vast opportunity. One who is born into a rich family is much more likely to stay rich just by maintaining the status quo, whereas one who is not must work for it, fighting toothe and nail. Sure, wealth can be lost, but it is less likely. And that's what it ultimately comes down to. Money buys opportunity, opportunity that those less fortunate do not have. If you have money, the finish line has been placed closer to you. This is why we idolize the rags to riches stories, because subconsciously, we know how difficult that must be, versus being born with a silver spoon in hand.\n\nI understand and sympathize that that is their money, and they have every right to do with it what they will, within reasonable legal boundaries. They should indulge and reap the rewards of their success and their ancestors success. Few suggest otherwise, and if they do, they don't fully understand the meaning behind phrases such as \"tax the rich.\"  But every person owes a debt to society, and they still need to pay it, otherwise we'd still be living in caves.","created_utc":1531024937,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Basically anything that raises standard of living runs this risk, but the solution is not to stop trying to raise disposable income, but to address housing supply so that prices come down:\n\n&gt;what they are arguing is that a UBI leads to higher rents that consume the value of the UBI. But what they are actually arguing is that a UBI increases disposable incomes and that increasing disposable incomes leads to higher rents that consume the value of the income increase. Stated this way, the shocking nature of the theory becomes clear: *if true, the theory predicts that anything that increases people\u2019s incomes is pointless.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Fight for $15 is pointless. The fight for unions that can negotiate higher wages is pointless. The fight for a more generous welfare state is pointless. Nearly everything that people talk about with respect to the economy and what could be done to improve the plight of the bottom half is actually pointless. Why? Because in all cases the internal mechanism of those proposals \u2014 increasing disposable incomes \u2014 is counteracted by a corresponding rise in rents, according to this particular anti-UBI theory.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Needless to say, I think the theory is pretty obviously false. Rises in disposable incomes generally do leave people better off, even net of rent payments, even in places where local authorities allow the price of space to spiral out of control.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But if you think it is true, you really should ask yourself what the source of the problem you have identified is. If it\u2019s the case that higher minimum wages, stronger unions, and more generous welfare states are all helpless against rent hikes, then maybe the issue you are worried about has nothing to do with the UBI and everything to do with your area\u2019s dumb housing policy.\n\nalso replying to \/u\/starstrewn","created_utc":1531042678,"score":13,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I disagree w\/ him vehemently on many issues, so are all democrats obama bootlickers?\n\nAssault is assault. I\u2019m not comparing the two to say they are acceptable, but you are saying that because you don\u2019t agree with the speech of SOME participants, it\u2019s alright to assault them all? Sorry, but that\u2019s assanine. Trump supporters &amp; their bodyguards have been stabbed in the streets - is that domestic terror? I would argue that the second you use violence against a person for political reasons, you are now the domestic terrorist. I would fight &amp; die to protect your right to disagree with me &amp; call me whatever you feel like, but it appears you do not hold the right to free speech &amp; association in high regard, which is a shame. \n\nI honestly think the hostility these days is because the left assumes we will behave the same way once we are the party in power (silencing dissent, abusing justice department, IRS targeting conservatives.) I firmly believe that is a main difference between the two parties, as if an individual disagrees with the left you are slandered &amp; labeled as a \u201cracist, sexist, BOOTLICKER, fascist, hitler, demagogue, take your pick\u201d) \n\nthere is just as much hate &amp; idiotic policy positions on the left as on the right. I can clearly identify what I support &amp; do not support within my political party, are you able to rationally do the same? If so, I challenge you to find 5 MAJOR policies you disagree w\/ about the dempcratic party &amp; express why you don\u2019t agree with them. Here\u2019s some of mine :\n- abortion, gay marriage, overseas adventurism, treating people differently based on any factor not tied to meritocracy. \n\nIf you react w\/ this much hate to a moderate that regularly votes with &amp; agrees with the center-left how do you expect to reach out to the rest of the country? Continue to denigrate them as \u201chillbillies, rednecks, white trash\u201d or the other labels? Accuse them of hating others, wanting to enslave them, or ad hominem attacks? The major problem with the country is when you demoniZe &amp; dehumanize those who you disagree with instead of trying to understand why they may hold those beliefs or what motivates them. \n\nBest of luck with your \u201calerts\u201d as your sitting at a healthy -1 on your own liberal subreddit. Why don\u2019t you tell me more about how you represent the party or love &amp; compassion, or is that only when you want to make a religious based argument to beat a conservative over the head with? (Go for it, I\u2019m an agnostic.) \n\nPlease now calmly reply with the quotes about abortion \/ drug addiction that you are posting about. I\u2019m seeing massive efforts to combat the opiate epidemic as well as secure our borders (where do you think the drugs come from? Just asking for 255 million friends.) \n\nI\u2019m capable of thinking clearly &amp; calmly about a situation without letting my personal bias creep in. For example, do you agree or disagree w\/ Obama DOJ  sending assault rifles to Mexico without oversight? Same w\/ him shutting down the investigation into hezbollah cocaine &amp; drug trafficking. \n\nRealistically many liberals, including yourself,  would have the same reaction to any conservative who doesn\u2019t stand 100% behind what you personally believe. The proof is in the attacks used in the last 20 years on 100% of the presidential candidates that were nominated, attacks that never would have materialized toward left leaning political figures. \n\nHere is some friendly advice : get outside, hit the gym &amp; get a love interest of your own. If I believed we had souls, yours would be black with rot &amp; hate, meanwhile I\u2019m out here loving life while we jumpstart the economy (3% growth won\u2019t happen by magic, those jobs are gone) - I guess I support trump because he is a magician i guess, no other way to explain how such a racist, fat, deranged, stupid, transphobic, hateful, small hand &amp; penis individual would be able to accomplish more in 2 years than the last 8 years under your favorite demagogue. \n- border secure, fewest crossings in years. \n- trying to fix the immigration system (left doesn\u2019t care about this why? Do they like the current explorative environment toward the undocumented?) \n- North Korea, while a massive wildcard &amp; I personally think will remain a major issue, but at least we got them to stop testing ICBMs &amp; nukes, that\u2019s a start. \n- isis went from \u201comg they will conquer the whole world\u201d to being snuffed out like an ant. \n- the economy ROARING back to life\n\nI could go on, but than you would cherry pick a few stats, post a few quotes about what he SAID instead of what he has DONE. I would rather have a president who sticks his foot in his mouth than up my ass, but again, I\u2019m not LGBT so maybe that explains something also. \n\nIn short dude, we probably aren\u2019t even all that different. I have maybe one conservative friend, while the rest are flaming leftists (including my girlfriend, who\u2019s mother is a LEGAL immigrant who did it the right way.) the really weird part? \n\nWe are almost in complete agreement on the issues mentioned, it\u2019s only the insanely far-left who believes in 32+ genders &amp; that women and men are biologically IDENTICAL, including muscle &amp; bone density. (Otherwise why is hitting a woman taboo? They are the same as men right? What is a man or woman even, we have 30+ other genders? So how can you have women\u2019s rights, or feminism if gender is a societal construct? \n\nPM me if you want to have a real discussion you might learn something talking to a real life person who disagrees with you. Isn\u2019t that what democracy is about? Discussing our problems instead of punching those we disagree with? My last point is all those on the left calling for an uprising or civil war, who do you think owns all those LEGALLY registered firearms in the country?

When conservatives argue for cutting funds to things like Planned Parenthood, they're doing so because of a moral objection and usually hide it under the guise of being \"fiscally conservative\"; the issue is though, they aren't fiscally conservative because of the amount of money they want to spend on other things (most commonly the military).\n\ntl;dr libertarians believe that a woman has a right to have an abortion based on her personal liberty (loosely though, assuming an unborn child doesn't have liberty.

The important portion of that statement is the right is by no means being constrained due to the left taking the high road on any issue.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt; **We shouldn't engage in behavior that we don't think should be engaged in on the merits**, but we shouldn't pretend the right is holding back out of a sense of fair play. \n\nI inferred the other traits bc if all they care about is power and if their policies are morally wrong (which I assume you think they are) well then by definition that would make them uncaring(except for power) villains. \n\nI agree with the bolded part of your last statement however I think that's the beginning and end of it. I don't see how what the right is willing to do comes into play.  As you say(Im paraphrasing), we shouldn't engage in 'bad' behavior.\n\n&gt;  \\&gt; Second, do you honestly think it's for the good of the country if protesting and yelling at people outside their homes becomes the standard for how we engage with political opponents?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do you not find the separation of children from their parents especially galling? What I honestly believe is that people have the ability to respond proportionally to the actions of their government and the idea that there should be some limit on their response regardless of the activities the government is engaging in because otherwise the limits will disappear completely is misanthropic. \n\nAnd here's the emotional appeal. Look, what's happening at the border is a travesty. Our immigration system has been in dire need of reform for decades now and this latest controversy with the kids being separated with no easy way to reunite them is horrible. Now having said that, I asked a very simple question about whether you think it's a good for our country if the standard way to engage with political opponents is yelling outside their homes. Could you please answer that question without deflecting?\n\n&gt;\\&gt;Right but the **type** of blowback matters. The ends do not justify the means  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So those statements have opposite meanings. The first suggests that this strategy is not the best way to achieve our policy goals. I will readily admit that is possible and a very valid criticism that should not be dismissed. If such tactics are counter productive in the long run they should be abandoned. The second statement suggests that even if we knew for certain this strategy would get us exactly what we wanted we would not be justified in engaging in such tactics. I think that is patently false.\n\nI think this is really the crux of our disagreement.  Let me address both the points you make here. First, I **do** think that the tactic of calling on liberals to yell and confront people in public will do farm more harm to the liberals than the politicians they are harassing. It will make their political opponents on the right victims while alienating the less extreme and moderate democrats from the party. So on a pure numbers game where the goal is drawing people to a cause and changing minds of independents, I don't think what Maxine Waters did helps at all.\n\nAdditionally, and this is the most important piece, even if it *would* lead to the policy change the left is looking for, I still wouldn't think it was worth it. Let me explain why.\n\n&gt; On the one hand we have a few of the most privileged individuals in the world being moderately inconvenienced because they are perpetrating what is widely seen as abhorrent behavior, on the other we have thousands of families literally being ripped apart by those policies. I don't see how you can say the latter doesn't justify the former if you knew the end result would go in your favor. \n\nFirst, I agree that a mild inconvenience is nothing in the face of being separated from your child.  I disagree with your assessment that what Maxine called for was nothing more than inconveniences.  She didn't call for peaceful protest, she called for angry mobs. \"*you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere*\". Now, I don't believe she was explicitly calling for people to form mobs and push cabinet members, at least I hope she wasn't and I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that when she said \"push back\" she meant ideologically and was not causing for physical violence. However if you've ever been around a mob of angry people before, you can probably attest yourself that nuances like that are easily lost in the heat of emotion and outrage.  What Maxine called for was essentially the formation of powder kegs around her political opponents. \n\n&gt;\\&gt;The Civil Rights leaders were strategic and the demonstrators highly disciplined in non violent protest.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm always a little suspicious of these arguments. They can be made in good faith, but often the seem to end up being an attempt to set the bar so high for any sort of action that that it becomes an insurmountable barrier.\n\nI think not calling for angry mobs to form isn't a very high bar. Maxine spoke out of a very passionate and outraged place. I know **why** she said what she said, but it wasn't good. I'm not saying she needs to be as eloquent as MLK but she and every other person on the left that wants to enact change needs to understand why the Civil Rights movement was successful. The leaders of that movement had far more to be upset and aggrieved about than anything we are dealing with today, yet they were incredibly successful at not just changing laws but changing hearts and minds. The 'angry mob' strategy was a losing one back then, and I think it's a losing one today.\n\nps. I think you're dope for engaging with me, even if we disagree. thanks..","created_utc":1531167257,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Hello_Im_Matty","body":"To add to what you\u2019re saying, I\u2019ve talked about this a few times on reddit. White male privilidge is absolutely a thing but white males can have very hard lives. I say that as a white straight male who has brittle bones and broke several bones on a year on average as a kid. \n\nI remember watching something on Nickelodeon (That show with Linda Elerby) when I was younger about a girl who had what I have (Osteogenesis Imperfecta) and she lived in a tribe in the Amazon and had to be carried everywhere. When I was younger I had an attitude that I shouldn\u2019t complain and people who have it easier than I definitely shouldn\u2019t whine.\n\nThen I decided one day to quit Paxil which I was taking for years for anxiety (Maybe PTSD) and a form of OCD where I compulsively worry about things that are irrational. Going off of Paxil basically showed me what real depression is. I had been sad before but I had never felt real severe depression.  I had felt extreme physical pain but extreme emotional pain is really hard to describe. What I was feeling was pure despair and nothing else. Like I would never be happy again. I had nothing to look forward to and I didn\u2019t want to be happy again. I felt like what happiness i experienced before was almost felt by a different, naive person. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve had an attitude that, yes things could be worse, and I am thankful that, if I have to deal with brittle bones, at least it\u2019s in a California where there is a good healthcare system and life could be harder if I lived somewhere else or were not a white straight male. But now I no longer think a person should stop whining if they haven\u2019t dealt with things that are as bad as the things I\u2019ve dealt with. I\u2019m sympathetic to any situation that makes someone else feel bad. If they\u2019re having a bad day or they twisted an ankle. Or if they\u2019re dealing with something very serious, physically, emotionally, or whatever. And I also recognize that just because someone has dealt with much worse than I have, doesn\u2019t mean I haven\u2019t dealt with quite a bit.\n\nThe odds of being a living thing is really small. While we\u2019re alive it\u2019s important that our lives are happy. What makes a person good is being sympathetic when a person or animal is not happy. (I\u2019m not saying be a vegan, but do treat animals well, or at least not poorly because while they\u2019re alive their happiness matters too.)\n\nFor whatever reason when a minority or female talks about the troubles they face some white guys will dismiss what they\u2019re dealing with or even antagonize them. Nobody is obligated to listen to or care about anyone\u2019s issues. Not everybody is a nurturing, caring person. That\u2019s fine, but when a person talks about the things they faced and you deny what they deal with because they\u2019re not white male or straight means you\u2019re simply not a caring person or a fair minded person. And antagonizing or mistreatin a person because they\u2019re talking about the things they deal with as a minority, female, or LGBT makes you an actively bad person.","created_utc":1531210633,"score":4,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

As in any place in the US, children will be separated from their parents upon detention for a crime. Whether it be a misdemeanor or serious crime. With the zero tolerance policy, this resulted in more people being detained for longer periods of time due to the massive change of border patrol detention efforts actually working instead of simple catch and release. Same thing applies to any child who is detained, if they can't be out with a relative or foster, then it results in their separate detention while the \"parents\" or accompanied adult follows through with conviction of entering the United States from an illegal point of entry. Children wouldn't be charged, ever, simply sent back to whoever family they had wherever they came from, placed in foster care, or kept in a holding facility until either of those two are sought through. Don't blame trump for separating children. He's not, he put in place a policy to attempt to fix catch and release issued which have only increased the number of children being held. Something that has been done for years, but simply increased in volume slightly due to criminal actual criminal processing.

I'm also an enthusiastic fan of a court system that is willing to tell the government when to heel. Madison anticipated that legal and constitutional limits would only restrain the state so much given inherent power-seeking behavior.

That public shaming worked, and that's why I'm all for public shaming (in real life). It puts a face to the horrific words spoken or actions; a face that can be named and shamed.\n\nHorrific people are free to say whatever horrific things they want, but they're not free from the consequences of said speech.\n\nI remember growing up, Nazi's and racists of that caliber were always the butt of the jokes, always dismissed as dumbasses with their head way up their asses and treated as such, never given the time of day. That's how it needs to be once again, but since they're all so emboldened right now, there needs to be public shaming of which we've never seen, so that they go back to the shadows they existed in decades ago. There is no place for people like that in any modern society.\n\nAs for \"shaming them into listening\", I never meant that as my point, and I apologize if I wasnt' clear. My point is that *they don't want to listen, nor learn any opposing viewpoints at all.*\n\nThere is no point forcing the horse to drink, especially when you can't even lead him close to water.\n\nHere's a tip: next time you encounter and have a conversation with a Trump supporter, don't challenge anything, just ask them questions. Be curious about what they're saying and ask for more information like where they heard or read that and what do they think about it. Ask them more questions as if you know nothing and want to know more. I guarantee by the 2nd or 3rd question, they'll be in a logic knot, unable to say anything past talking points, backing nothing up with facts, and will start to get either defensive or mad, or both. If they're unwilling to go further down the rabbit hole and think about those things coming out of their mouth, then they may be reachable, otherwise, they'll just get mad and dig in further because they don't like to be challenged, it's hard for them.","created_utc":1531239363,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Islam is an individual's expression of their belief in God, through avenues that are informed largely by culture, heritage, and tradition. In very similar ways to the other two Abrahamic religions, adherents are not believers because they read all of the texts and picked the one they liked most. They usually pick the one that their family and community have followed for generations. The book isn't the source of religious knowledge, it almost always comes after the fact. Like all monotheistic religious texts, the Qaran says terribly cruel and ignorant things. But it also says profound and thought provoking things. The same way that the Bible both says to stone gays, but also to love thy neighbor. Well, which do you choose? That's a decision made by different religious sects, and by the cultures. Some Muslims drink, some don't. Some are openly gay, others hate the gays. Some are for religious tolerance, and others for religious intolerance. And each one can point to a passage in the Qaran that they can claim justifies their position. It's not the Qaran that's the problem, and it's not Islam that's a problem, it's radical conservative readings of Islam and the conservatives in positions of powef creating hateful movements behind them. Be upset with the radical conservative Muslim clerics in Iran that support terrorism and despise women. But don't shit on the wonderful liberal Muslim majority in Tehran that wants to join American liberals in lifting the shackles of dogmatic religious conservatives that use the government to limit our freedoms.

{"author":"WorseThanHipster","body":"&gt;  see liberalism as a advocating for direct federal government involvement in our lives and in the community. \n\nYou have absolutely no idea whatsoever what liberalism is.  You are waaaay off base.\n\n&gt; I believe in absolute preservation of the free market, independence of businesses, and independence of community power. \n\nThat is a liberalism.  Every single one of those is liberalism.\n\n&gt; It is a conservative belief that it should be the community\u2019s responsibility to help those less fortunate within the same community, not the federal government to redistribute wealth.\n\nActually, conservatism *necessitates* top down authority, and with that authority come responsibility:\n\n&gt; [Conservatism is a political and social philosophy promoting traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization. The central tenets of conservatism include tradition, human imperfection, organic society, hierarchy and authority and property rights.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conservatism)\n\nNothing about liberalism whatsoever inherently requires top down distribution of wealth.  You're thinking of socialism, which is completely different from liberalism.  In fact, liberalism is a political and moral philosophy whose central tenant is equally applied ***liberty***.  Socialism is an economic framework.\n\nI'm just going to stop here.  I don't mean to be insulting, but you seem to be *extremely* confused about what Liberalism is, what conservatism is, and what isn't Socialism.  It's not your fault, you're obviously interested, but your understandings are very shallow, prevailing 'pop-political philosophy,' and unfortunately there's a lot of misinformation around it because, as the 'pop' implies, it's the most *popular* narrative, and a lot of forces are vying for control of that narrative.\n\nIf you think that *everyone* should be born with the same freedoms and liberty, than you're a liberal.  Now, there are arguments to be had:  Some, and by some I mean absolutely most, liberals believe that government is NOT the sole arbiter of freedom;  That the buck does not stop there.  They also think that other things can also hinder your liberty, like economics, corporations, the church, local communities, that they can deny your liberties as well.  That's where 'protections' come in, which is the purpose of the constitution:  to guarantee all individuals' liberty by outlawing practices which violate liberties as laid out by the amendments in the constitution.  *The constitution is a liberal document.*\n\nNow, the implementation and scope of those protections is up for debate.  Some would argue that liberty is not inherently equal by birth.  Many liberals believe that liberty is tied to economics.  For instance, the rich seem to benefit from a different legal system than the rest of us.  Some would say you can buy your way out of jail, that you can buy law enforcement, or the lack of law enforcement, that you can buy privacy, you can buy your way to lower taxes, that you can buy additional representation in government.  It goes the other way too.  Some say the poor don't get adequate legal protection, some argue that regardless of the letter of the law, the way it is applied makes it all but illegal to be homeless.  \n\nIf a an american liberal agrees with any of those statements, then to say ideologically consistent they would demand that government protections be extended to protect people from those abuses of power.  \n\nTo split the debate further, some think part of the solution is to try harder to apply the law equally.  Others think part of the solution is to help.  Others think the solution is to lower the effects of income inequality through programs, like that guarantee a bed, and\/or food, public libraries, public education, public transportation, or opportunities of employment, education, mental health care.  Others think part of the solution is to address income inequality itself, through things like progressive taxation, and universal basic income.  Most Democrats in America share varying amounts of belief in any or all of those approaches, but you might be surprised how varied it can be.\n\nAll of this falls under liberalism, but none of it is 'inherent' in liberalism, but rather disagreements about observations, their interpretations, and implementation details.  Socialism is different.  It's a different area and is not incompatible, nor inherent, in liberalism.  It's outside of it.\n\nConservatism on the other hand, promotes hierarchy, a government that enforces a culture, through religion, through promotion, rewarding following social norms and punishing, or outright outlawing, deviations from those norms.  If you ask most any political science scholar, or american historian, they will agree with these shallow assessments I've given.\n\nSo, you see why I say you are confused.  I suggest you stop looking to social media, blogs, news, for your political opinions.  I suggest you read letters, pamphlets, papers, articles, and debates by the founding fathers, and enlightenment era philosophers.  They are the one's who shaped our democracy.  They built the foundations of our political system.  I also suggest you read opinions of famous supreme court cases, particularly early to late 20th century, as they provide insights into today's legal interpretations of the constitution.  I suggest you take a political science course, and an american history course, and not argue with your professors until you fully understand that, and why, the United States of America is a **liberal democracy**, *and* a constitutional republic.","created_utc":1531249278,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

There was a pretty detailed financial proposal for it, so I did the math for my personal situation. I currently pay, between my and my employer's contributions, about $15k a year for a family policy with a $4k deductible. Under the proposed Colorado health care plan, I would have paid around $8k in additional tax (again, between me and my employer, and this was after a ramp-up period where I would pay less). There were no deductibles, just co-pays that were pretty reasonable and would probably never equal the $4k deductible I currently have. So $8-10k in tax and co-pays versus $15-19k in insurance premiums and deductible. And it would have covered more than just my family. \n\nWe're pretty healthy. This year is only the second time in 22 years that we've met the deductible. The only other time was when I gave birth to my now 19-year-old daughter. So 90% of the time, we get no benefit other than negotiated rates and the ability to put pre-tax money in an HSA. And nobody else gets to use it either because it's only for us. \n\nThe Colorado bill failed miserably - 80% against. I didn't expect it to pass, but I had hoped it would have a little better showing than that and maybe get reworked and put back on the ballot. I guess only 20% of the voters did the math. Either that or there's just a huge stigma against paying for things as a tax instead of to a private corporation. That may make sense for a lot of things, but not for health care.

When he says things like this he's really just saying that Russia is a formidable opponent but that he'll be able to do it easily when in reality it should be hard. He's just flexing his muscles a little bit. At the NATO meeting Trump criticized Germany for making bad trade deals with Russia that would make them dependent on Russian energy. This does not sound like someone who is in cahoots with Russia. It does seem to be the case that Russia influenced the election to help Trump win, and Is still trying to influence public opinion. I don't think Trump has anything to do with this though, I really think Russia sees Trump being in office as an opportunity to divide us as a country and to destabilize our nation. \n\nI have a personal suspicion that they're doing this in preparation for a European war. Germany did something similar to Russia in world war 1, and I think they learned a lot from this mistake. ","created_utc":1531330082,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

It's a scientific fact that people understand our world through the lense of various metaphors, and the relevant metaphor for politics is that of family. A nation is a family, and the conservative movement has successfully framed their morally and economically bankrupt hostility to actual health*care* reform as a 'family value.'\n\nBut in fact the privatized health market is devoid of family values -- there is only apathy, greed, and inefficiency. We are living in a house of absentee parents, who welcome the wild bear of the insurance industry in when what we need is care. Not only that -- the bear is invited to tear open the fridge, devour everything it wants, and in return hand us bandaids for broken bones and cancer. If the fridge is state-of-the-art and stuffed with gourmet vittles, the bear might pull an aching tooth -- and then demand a $500 bottle of wine for the aspirin it gives us for the pain. If a child has a bedroom full of golden-fruit sculptures, the bear will do everything it can for that child, and neglect the others all the more.\n\nWhat we in the U.S. need is family values in our healthcare -- and in order to get them, we'll need to promote those values to the electorate.","created_utc":1531330383,"score":15,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King.  But this is how dishonest the media is.\n\nSo, he clearly hadn't researched who has been on the cover of Time how often.  All he knows is he's been on the cover a huge number of times.  It was an off-the-cuff statement whose purpose was to point out how hypocritical Time is for profiting off him with all those cover stories and then also looking for ways to slam him with false accusations like he removed MLK's bust.\n\n**It is perfectly clear that this is not a lie**, but some off-the-cuff hyperbole based on his personal experience, all in the service of a point about media dishonesty.

{"author":"ting_bu_dong","body":"An interesting take on this whole mess:\n\nhttp:\/\/zeihan.com\/this-is-how-the-world-ends-part-ii\/\n\nTo that end Merkel noted two days after the Americans withdrew from the Iran deal that \u201cit\u2019s no longer the case that the United States will simply just protect us. Let\u2019s face it, Europe is still in its infancy with regard to the common foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBut while her words were a call for Europe to deepen its integration, her actions indicated something very different. If the Americans cannot be trusted to put Europe first, then the Germans have no choice but to act to prevent a broad-scale coalition from containing German interests. That means courting new allies\u2026 from beyond Europe. And so after making the comments that Europe needed to pull together, Merkel didn\u2019t travel to Brussels. Or Paris.\n\nShe went to Moscow.\n\nNow don\u2019t overreact. I\u2019m not saying that Molotov-Ribbentrop v2.0 is just around the corner. What I\u2019m saying is that even with seven decades of the most favorable strategic environment the European continent could have ever hoped for, that a meaningful strategic and political merging of the European countries still hasn\u2019t happened. That forces the individual powers of Europe to chart their own \u2013 individual \u2013 destinies. For the United Kingdom that means Brexit. For the Italians that means a new populist government that will veto any effort to further federalize the EU. For the French that means some serious globetrotting to build up an independent strategic position.\n\nAnd for Germany it means putting some irons in the fire that have nothing to do with Europe whatsoever. That means economic and energy connections to Russia. That means at least giving Russian demands a hearing. That means taking Russian strategic interests into account as concerns the countries between Germany and Russia.\n\nOK, maybe that does sound a bit like a Molotov-Ribbentrop redux.\n\nNever forget that the founding concept of the EU and NATO were to keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down.

{"author":"Kerplonk","body":"&gt;I inferred the other traits bc if all they care about is power and if their policies are morally wrong (which I assume you think they are) well then by definition that would make them uncaring(except for power) villains.\n\nThat is a poor inference on your part.  You can disagree with a person without demonizing them.  I don't think it's morally wrong to want less immigration.  If republicans had the votes to implement stronger border security and reduce legal immigration that's just something those of us who want a more generous immigration policy would have to deal with.  Trying to force the issue by being overtly cruel to immigrants is an immoral means to those ends, but the ends are not immoral in and of themselves.\n\n&gt;I don't see how what the right is willing to do comes into play. \n\nYou were the one who initially brought this up \u201cOnce you decide that \"if it's justified, bad behavior becomes OK\" then you open the door for someone else to decide that they are justified in bad behavior.\u201d  I\u2019m open to the idea that these practices are bad strategy or unjustified, but the idea that those on the right will or won\u2019t do something because the left is trying to hold or set a social norm is a fantasy in my opinion.\n\n&gt;I asked a very simple question about whether you think it's a good for our country if the standard way to engage with political opponents is yelling outside their homes. Could you please answer that question without deflecting?\nYou didn\u2019t ask a simple question, you presented a false binary choice of such tactics being always used or never used.  I wasn\u2019t deflecting I was pointing that out.  Obviously it would be bad if every position an elected official took resulted in them being constantly accosted by groups of angry citizens.  It would be equally bad if not worse if citizens put some artificial limit on the effective tactics they were willing to engage in to oppose a government policy independent of how morally reprehensible that policy became.  I believe those on the left are fully capable of making that distinction, and again I don\u2019t believe the behavior of the right is effected by us one way or the other.  This policy is maybe the low bar for the tactics being used but it's definitely within the range of things that we should view as legitimate government actions.\n\n&gt; First, I do think that the tactic of calling on liberals to yell and confront people in public will do farm more harm to the liberals\n\nI don\u2019t currently have an opinion as to if these tactics will be effective or not.  It seems to me most people are either not paying attention or have already made up their minds when it comes to politics so I have my doubts that it will play out as suggested in your scenario, but at the same time if you've voluntarily taken a job in the Trump administration it's hard to imagine having enough shame\/pride to be influenced by social condemnation of any sort.\n\n&gt;Additionally, and this is the most important piece, even if it would lead to the policy change the left is looking for, I still wouldn't think it was worth it.\n\nI think there is a big distinction between encouraging violence and encouraging confrontation and I don\u2019t think Waters crossed it.  There's always the possibility some crazy person is going to take words out of context but I think the line between a group of angry citizens and angry mob is wider than you are assuming.  The Tea party managed to spend years berating politicians at town halls without physically attacking anyone, I'm confident the left can do so at restaurants with the same restraint.\n\n&gt;I think not calling for angry mobs to form isn't a very high bar\n\nThe thing is she wasn't, and that's the problem I have with this argument in general.  It doesn't seem to matter what people are doing they're always being just a little to confrontational, or they're creating a situation that might become to confrontational and back fire.  I agree with you if everyone on the left was like the mythical MLK civil rights activists of yore that could set Ghandi traps left and right we'd be better off, but you go to war with the army you have, and while you are absolutely right we shouldn't encourage actual violence, we shouldn't be so scared of confrontation that we don't encourage action at all.\n\nps. thank you as well, I have really enjoyed the conversation thus far.\n","created_utc":1531393636,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The late engagement suggests Kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. This includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments.

And then either we'll default or, more likely, we'll see skyrocketing inflation as the government simply prints money. Either way, we'll all be totally screwed because we had such a ginormous government.\n\n&gt;You don't think people deserve the same rights and protections across the US and that states can preempt some if they feel like it?\n\nI think there are certain rights and protections that are universal to everyone. But there are a whole lot more that are very culture-specific. For instance, how should public lands be used? The best use will vary from place to place, so just saying all public land everywhere can only be used for recreation is a very poor choice, since some might be better suited for grazing.\n\n&gt;You don't think that state government \"smaller\" can't be oppressive. \n\nOf course a small government can be oppressive. City governments tend to be *incredibly* oppressive with their zoning codes (creating artificial scarcity). But it's much more difficult to be **as** oppressive as a big one. As an analogy, it is possible for me to kill 100 people with my bare hands. It's easier to do it with a knife. Even easier with a gun, and almost impossible for me not to do it with a fully-loaded commercial jetliner. Similarly, as a government gets bigger and more intrusive, it becomes easier and easier to do a bad thing, even on accident. And if it gets unwieldy, then it's real hard not to do a bad thing. And, besides, I don't mean we need a power*less* federal government, just one that is smaller and less powerful. For instance, the whole of the Department of Homeland Security...what does it do that the Departments of Defense and Justice couldn't do? The Department of Education is a driving force in the inflation of college tuition (and does it do anything else besides coercing schools into adopting common core and standardized tests?). And why can't the states take over the national parks within their respective borders?\n\n&gt;You think rather than trying to improve government it's just better to eliminate it? You think the average citizen would have any recourse against a corporation say that abused their rights if they had to do it without any government regulations or assistance?\n\nI think the best way to improve government is to narrow its focus. There is plenty to get rid of in the federal government. A lot of which can (and should) be delegated to the state and\/or local governments. I absolutely think the federal government should retain the ability to bust up monopolies, but shouldn't be allowed to bail out ~~monopolies~~ too-big-to-fail companies, a la 2009.\n\nAnd groups like the ACLU exist to protect people's rights. And people have the right to unionize to bargain for better working conditions. And I'm not advocating for wholesale removal of regulations. Some regulations are good. But some are also bad.\n\n&gt;Less govt is all fine an dandy if you're someone that wants to do something for your own benefit at the expense of others.\n\nI would argue that *more* government is better if you want to do something for your own benefit at the expense of others. More government gives more opportunities for subsidies (i.e. taking other people's money as your own) and regulations that give specifically you an unfair advantage over others.\n\nMy thought is that, since democracies encourage irresponsible spending, we should contain the risk to the individual person as much as possible, rather than pushing it onto everyone else and then screwing us all over when it comes crashing down on our collective heads.","created_utc":1531404599,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

There was a news article where a husband and wife was considering a divorce so the mother and child who needed the care would qualify for Medicaid in TX.\n\n-People understand their employer provided health care insurance companies and hospitals have to power to make life and death decisions based upon the medicines and care they agree to cover or not cover.

Once the GOP believes it has sufficient support, we on the left worry that it will resort to harder measures to protect Trump and his allies by dismissing Robert Mueller and installing GOP loyalists in investigative and prosecutorial positions in the DoJ.  If the GOP is successful in putting loyalists in federal courts, it can then pass authoritarian policies without much fear that they will be struck down by the judiciary.\n\nYou may think it's alarmist on the part of the left but once we get to the point where harder, concrete measures are being taken by Republicans, it's much, much harder to undo than it it's stopped in its tracks right now.","created_utc":1531497760,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"CareBearDontCare","body":"A few different things at play.  For decades, the Republican Party did a bangup job of marginalizing actual Socialists and actual Communists.  They were always around, just marginalized, mainly because those two \"isms\" were always put in tow with the USSR and Europe and what not.  The Democratic Party also did a yeoman's job of keeping actual Socialists and Communists out of the discourse as well, in part because the Republican Party did such a great job of smearing the term \"Liberal\" along with \"Socialist\" or \"Communist\".  Thirdly, the actual Socialists and Communists were never well organized, in part because they were marginalized by the main parties, but also because they didn't do a great job in that task either.\n\nFast forward to 2010.  The Tea Party gets massive institutional support from the Republican Party and gets coopted, and you have people who argue for zero regulations that get into office and wield power.  The discourse gets shifted to the right, and you have op-ed pieces asking if America has shifted fundamentally to the political right because of this midterm wave in 2010.  (It hasn't.)\n\nEvery action gets an equal and opposite reaction, and you're seeing that right now.  We've had almost a decade of people arguing for zero regulation.  The counterpoint to that isn't \"some regulation\".  The counterpoint to that is Communism. Fringe elements from both sides of the spectrum have always been around, and will always be around.\n\nI like to point to John Dingell as an interesting litmus test for these kinds of things.  He's the longest serving representative in American history and recently retired.  Every new session, he'd re-introduce his father's single-payer healthcare bill, out of respect. His signature is on the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Civil Rights Act, and so much more.  His signature is on the very nature of who we are as Americans.  He also pushed back against stronger environmental regulations, he has a lifetime A+ rating from the NRA, and was on the board of the NRA before they got hyper politicized and lost their damned minds.  So, how do you rank someone like that?  Extremely liberal?  Moderate?  A lot of Democrats in office are pretty similar, where they have a pet issue that they're pretty liberal about, and most where they're pretty moderate.  You're seeing more people that are running for office now that are more liberal across the board.  A lot of folks in office now are old enough to remember these days where they tried to do the Very Liberal Thing and paid a huge price for it. (A great example is Hillary Clinton. Pushed hard in the early '90s for single payer, ended up getting all kids covered with CHIP instead.) Are those folks who are old and experienced enough to remember those political scars they have going to go out on a liberal political limb to support something they want to do, but, for most of their political careers have been unable to garner support for?

They falls much more clearly within the bounds of Social-Democratism, and Democratic-Socialism (think the difference between liberal and neoliberal before you jump to the nomenclature).  Stuff like UBI, higher minimum wages, higher taxes on the wealthy at a more progressive rate, labor friendly work environments, and increased democratization of society through electoral reforms, certainly can be encouraged by self identified socialists, but wouldn't be what they identify as socialism.\n\nSocialism itself is *muuuuuuuuuch* more radical.  Socialism would advocate worker ownership of businesses instead of just labor friendly work environments, instead of affordable universal health care, socialism would argue it to be a crime to seek profit on medicine, especially for potentially debilitating conditions.  Where Democratic-Socialism advocates more friendly and cooperative relations with other nations, socialism advocates the eventual downfall of borders with those nations.\n\nAnother note is the difference in aims, a Democratic Socialist will state that their political goals are to reform the systems of government and economic management to most efficiently serve the will of the people with increased democratization of society.  \n\nA Socialist will identify their goal as the eventual global revolution of thought (or blood depending on whether you give credence to the tankies) that will bring down all borders and result in a communist civilization of Earth.  \n\nSo with all that comparing and contrasting, here's the answer to your question.  The Dems are being swept by Democratic-Socialists people like Bernie and Cortez who believe that our national wealth could and *should*  be put to programs which directly benefit and supplement the lives of the masses, and who believe in a massive wave of reforms for change the system of governance we currently use to be more reflective of the national opinion.

{"author":"Zelk","body":"The definition of what socialism is important here. Conservatives are blasted constantly with countries that have the government managing some or most aspects of the economy, which is the dumb down description of socialism, a command economy. An economy that is managed by people who are in the governing power, this doesn't mean the government is accountable to the people, that's what democracies and Republics are about.\n\nWhen we look at America's most effective fighting force, the U.S. Military, it is in many senses, a communist\/ socialist entity. It works, people are constantly working to cut cost and streamline processes, everyone's held accountable to someone in leadership. Resources are granted and people get pay for personal assets based on rank and job demand. So a person who's low ranking but in a high demand job may get a nice bonus vs a high ranking individual with a very low demand job.\n\nWhen we look at policies like healthcare, we see that the U.S. and Russia are the only countries with insurance based care, and financially when compared to other countries that apply single payer and the U.S. Military, we notice that more and more money isn't going into service, but insurance companies. Basically insurance has become a staggering line of middlemen that charge people nothing more than to simply be there and make the deal happen. We don't like this. It feels corrupt and shady, but the right keep demanding it's the best thing ever.\n\nLiberals \/ Democrats, look at the bigger picture of things and look for consolidated opinions of people who are experts in their field. This is why a lot of college professors and higher educated individuals lean or are liberal, and why conservatives\/ republicans have been aiming for high school level white males.\n\nSo... what conservitives keep pushing...\n\nBasically do the exact opposite of the U.S. Military.\n\nRather than having a hands on approach to problems in the economic and social sector, the right want a total hands off no accountability structure of privatization that will magically fix things. This might work if everyone was well paid and could afford to shop around, investigate organizations, and invest wisely. With health care, when you're knocked out, you don't have a choice and you can quickly wake up to a new mortgage, which means your finances will be crippled and you can't help your friends and family, less free time, less hobbies, less freedom, and more debt.\n\nTribes that basically say that human welfare is vital to a healthy society, and that pooling resources to buy in bulk and finance well things everyone uses such as roads, emergency services, infrastructure... setting up systems to do tolls or a bunch of middlemen to separate the customer and the business seems wasteful. I've lived in Japan, toll roads are stupid. Not only are you paying a high toll to stop in the middle of a highway to get from A to B, but you have to pay for the people working it and or system in place, which is just more complexity and cost that doesn't need to exist. It slows down traffic and productivity, wastes gas, breaks... the works. Just imagine having to stop two or three times to and from work to pay a couple bucks to a person literally standing in the road telling you to pay them money. We all use roads, even if you don't have a car, we need fire trucks and ambulances. It's just a no brainier.\n\nAccountability is another issue. Remember socialism is more about how the economy is governed, free market is economic anarchy. Socialism is the government controlling some or most important assets, communism is like the military where people are paid personal pay but everything else they use is public assets. Need a car? Apply for one, get one, use it, turn it in when you're done or go to the public auto shop to get it fixed up every x miles etc. They certainly don't want to see you again so they'll do their best the first time. Also because the government loves paperwork, whoever worked on it and messes up will get trained or looked at if they are stressed. They are having family issues? Get them time off and counseling. We want them to work at their 100&amp;#37; and not have to worry about the finances behind it. We can do it because we literally have counselors on salary waiting to use their degree and help people.\n\nSo accountability wise we look at the people, Democracies and Republics, where people have a say in things, and if a public official is corrupt, kill them. Public officials taking bribes to favor a business or potentially hostile power are basically robbing the people. People seem to accept some degree of corruption such as small favors here and their, but there's a pretty firm line.\n\nThe moment we go Plutocratic where money makes the rules, corruption runs rampant and the interest of officials is money, not the people's well being. Once power is consolidated and people in power secure their castles, everyone else starves. Money goes one way. We live in the highest productivity and quality of life in human history, we can absolutely build super cities requiring little to no gas and run totally off solar, we have over 500 billionaires in the states and rather than investing it or spending it in communities, they are shoving it in stocks to make more money. Money doesn't get spent and the people, you and I, have to keep tightening our belts.\n\nFree market and plutocratic\/ business run governments, don't work. There's zero evidence to support it. It's given us poverty, more hours, less pay, less freedom, less choice, bankruptcies, tolls, middlemen and crippling debt. It's stupid.   \n\n\nI know there are problems with socialist systems, I'm aware of Detroit and Venezuela, but what about Seattle? California? Germany? Sweden? The U.S. Military? Australia? Japan? China? What about all the other countries in the world? I don't like how India or Russia does things, or North Korea.... I don't like the idea of business first because workers seem to suffer, but I like the idea of a business owner being awarded for leading a good business.   \n\n\nWhen I tend to talk to conservatives, they seem to only cherry pick data and have absolutely no good examples of insurance based, business first, plutocratic, government free countries that are supposed to be the gold standard of how societies should run. Only bashing institutions about how bad they are, and not how to fix them.   \n\n\nIt's like playing sports and criticizing sports in general, but never coming up with something better. At the moment, that's what the right have been doing for decades.   \n\n\nThat's why socialism isn't just taking root, it's growing.","created_utc":1531508393,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Social democracy= government controlling enough to provide basic necessities for its citizens.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve sorted out the difference I\u2019ll answer the question. My best bet as I\u2019m not an expert is that most liberals, similar to many conservatives are sick of neoliberalism policy. Populism is surging in America, as evidenced by trumps victory after everything that went on in the election that should\u2019ve tanked his chances. I\u2019m a proud democrat, but it\u2019s true that the establishment DNC IS cozy with Wall Street, and does look out for corporations. Bernie bros hate that as much as trumpers. If one looks closely they can see the similarities between the rise of trumpism and social democracy. They both had the same grievances in the beginning, despite having different ideas on what should be done. Unfortunately I believe that trump was duping his voters as he has done anything but fight corporatism and stick up for the little guy. \n\nI genuinely love the attempt at civil discourse. I wish more folks on BOTH sides would understand that this is the only method of lasting change. If people could be civil with one another we would find the best solution.

{"author":"Kirkevalkery393","body":"To answer part one; the idea of \u201cexpanding federal government to take care of non constitutionally dictated issues\u201d is neither new or a break from classical liberalism. Indeed, founding liberal philosophers like John Locke, and Jean Jacques Rousseau advocated for social contracts the surrender some individual freedoms in order to benefit the collective good (Rousseau to a greater extent than Locke), and founding fathers Washington, Madison, and Hamilton where all advocates of the federal government having more power than the states, and argued that it should have powers not strictly laid out in the constitution (like the power to raise and pay a standing army\/navy, and the power to form a federal bank). This divide has been one of the central political conflicts in American history and has been at the heart of major political movements from abolition, to the progressive era, to the new deal, and the great society. As times change so do the needs that progressives respond to, most recently those have been expanding the social contract to *truly* include those that have been left out for all of American history, and realizing that \u201crugged individualism\u201d has really only worked for a tiny portion of the population. \n\nTo answer the second point; In \u201cOn Liberty\u201d J. S. Mill spends a great deal of time juxtaposing individual rights against what he calls the \u201charm principal\u201d. Essentially Mill argues that an individual has a right to most any freedom as long as it does not do harm to another. This principle is at the root of your question and what makes it so hard to answer. The case you provided actually works a little like a vaccine, on one hand if you are a young fit person, you are unlikely to need health care, on the other, your decision means that insurance providers spend way more money on the old an sick without that steady source of income from the young and healthy, so they have to raise prices or kick people off in order to make money. That can cause those people who need that insurance most a great deal of harm. This requiring you to pay for insurance is a collective good that may even benefit you if you have an accident or contract an infectious disease. At that point, it is the government\u2019s job to make sure that you don\u2019t get screwed by the insurance company by making and enforcing regulations, but the company doesn\u2019t have a market incentive to screw you since it needs to keep young people on the rolls in order to be economically viable. \n\nThe same principle applies more generally to things like pollution or gun control. If I live in Minnesota and we have strict water safety laws I still get affected by Wisconsin dumping pollution into the St. Croix. If I live in Chicago and we have strict gun laws, I can still get shot by a gun purchased in Wisconsin. Essentially federal laws and regulations mean that all the stars have to conform to the same laws in order to benefit the collective good. That doesn\u2019t mean States don\u2019t play an important role in making laws that are state specific (water rights that work well in Colorado probably wouldn\u2019t in Louisiana), but the stuff that *does* effect everyone should be legislated for everyone.

{"author":"EAO48","body":"The term has devolved more than it has evolved. It's routinely misused by a poorly informed public. This fact is well understood in socialist circles, but rarely understood in the more mainstream liberal circles, as evidenced by the downvoting of my previous comment on this liberal subreddit.\n\nLiberalism and socialism are incompatible because socialism is inherently anti-capitalist, and liberalism inherently pro-capitalist.\n\nThis is less apparent in the US than in the EU, as the US is ruled by a deliberate two-party system that leaves no room for a real leftist opposition.\n\nUnlike some other European states, the UK doesn't have a revolutionary socialist party in parliament, but it does have a social democratic party: the Labour Party. It might be interesting for you to see how Labour policies differ from Liberal Democrat policies, illustrated through [this Venn diagram](https:\/\/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk\/multimedia\/archive\/01632\/venn-diagram-big_1632966a.gif).\n\nNotice how Ocasio-Cortez, who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has proposed policies that no establishment Democrat would dream to propose, such as a federal job guarantee.\n\nDon't even let me get started on the schism between liberal feminism and radical feminism (the latter of which originated in socialist circles).\n\nSocialists are much more serious than any liberals about their opposition to capitalist imperialism in general and present-day American imperialism in particular. Controversially, many socialists see the US as a greater threat than any other regime today. Most socialist uphold the doctrine of \"proletarian internationalism.\"\n\nThe socialist movement began as an ideological superstructure to the labor movement, and so it places a much grater emphasis than does liberalism on organized labor (trade unions, workers' co-operatives, etc.). Since socialists see present-day governments as beholden to capital, they are also far more likely to reach outside party politics and electoral processes to exert social change, e.g. with non-profits, alternative media and \"direct action.\"\n\nWhat socialists seek is not merely a change in public policy direction but much more radical, structural change in society.\n\nThe bottom line is that we're talking not just about different political ideologies but about altogether different philosophies, different traditions. The word \"socialism\" was coined at the end of the 19th century by Henri de Saint-Simon as a contrast to the doctrine of liberal individualism (which stressed that people act or should act as if they are in isolation from one another).

This has been the case for illegal immigrants since 1997 - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reno_v._Flores\n \nWhile I agree that separating children from parents is heartbreaking, I'm not going to blatantly misrepresent what is happening and claim that Trump created this rule. He didn't. \nIf you, u\/-galahad-, were arrested and jailed tomorrow, your children would be taken from you. \n\nIf a rule is created, then stops being enforced for a decade, then someone else starts enforcing it again later on, the enforcer doesnt suddenly become the creator. \n\n&gt;-The massive tax cut to the rich which due away with estate tax and will create a $1.4 trillion deficit.\n\nThis is a longer more complex topic that I'm not well-enough informed about, so I'll move on. \n\n&gt;-Trade war with both Canada and China\n\nProbably not great, but again, I don't have all of the information. I think the results will speak for themselves eventually. \n\n&gt;You say people didn't want Obama to fail, but you can't verify that. That is just your assumption. \n\nTrue. And if others *did* want Obama to fail, they were wrong to want that as well.  \n\n&gt;The fact is that everything Republicans are saying about Democrats obstructing is something they've done to Obama for his entire two terms even when Obama wanted to compromise with them, going as far as doing things like offering to put a Republican on the Supreme Court. Yet, even then, Republicans still didn't want to cooperate. They literally obstructed him simply because he was Obama.\n\n\nYou are 100% right. While Democrats are also guilty of this in the past, it doesn't excuse the Republican's obstruction during Obama's terms. That said, shitty politics is shitty politics. At some point, if obstructionism is bad (which I think we all agree it is) then one party or the other needs to stop doing it at some point. Whether that's Democrats or Republicans, it doesnt matter. The parties will say \"but they other side does it too\" regardless. \n\nOne of the parties needs to take the high road. Why not the Democrats? Isnt this something Democrats pride themselves on anyway? \n\n&gt;What does failure mean? If failure means him not being able to do things like build a pointless wall or ban Muslims from the U.S., then yeah, in those issues I do not want him to succeed.\n\nI don't consider either of those things \"failures,\" regardless of what happens with the wall. Personally, I look at the economy and a myriad of other factors. The existence or non-existence of a wall won't be part of my analysis in judging his presidency (personally). \n\n&gt;If by some miracle he supports things like universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage, or investing in alternative energy, then by all means I'll support him in those decisions. But every policy he tries to push or has already passed is beyond regressive and has never been anything that I support.\n\nWe'll have to agree to disagree on universal healthcare and minimum wage. I think there are very valid arguments both ways on whether they are good or bad for the nation. ","created_utc":1531519889,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

That being said I think those that are in place are abused and inefficient. I do not see the super wealthy as the enemy and I think it is wrong to take from those men and women to give to others because you are not in their position. I think the burden of redistribution will fall on the largest demographic of the middle class. I do not see socialized countries coming out ahead as true market socialism takes all of a countries assets, freezes them there, and redistributes them.

The basic definition of fascism that Wikipedia provides is \" a form of radical authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry and commerce.\" \n\nA guy fed up with the state who decided to kill a bunch of republican officials- actions that almost all liberals would condemn- is in no way fascist. He doesn't support the state so he can't be ultranationalist, he isn't in favor of dictatorial power in any way; the only way he even gets close to the definition of fascism is that he tried to suppress republicans. But even there, his actions are miles away from fascist. Fascist suppression of political opposition would be systemic, executed by the state. Like how China arrests political opponents or makes them disappear. Fascism is not an angry, desperate man with a gun. It is systemic oppression by the state. \n\nThe leftists who attacked republicans at a college campus were also not fascists. They were not in support of any ruling body. Hell, a lot of Antifa supporters \/ leftist college kids are anarchists, how could they support the state? They certainly didn't act on the behalf of the government. These students aren't nationalist in any way- don't republicans constantly call leftist groups terrorists for burning flags and so forth? Not typical behavior of ultranationalists.

As the cliched movie poster has it, \u201cThis time, it\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\nBut with Trump, every time is personal. That, we are coming to realize, is what defines his foreign policy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve listened to Trump talk about Putin over the last few years, you\u2019ve seen this again and again. He seldom speaks about relations with Russia in terms of America\u2019s strategic interests \u2014 whether they be military or economic or anything else, let alone Russia\u2019s actions. Instead, it\u2019s almost always about whether the two countries, and whether he and Putin particularly, will \u201cget along.\u201d For instance, here are some of his remarks about Putin at a press conference yesterday in Brussels:\n\n&gt; He\u2019s been very nice to me the times I\u2019ve met him. I\u2019ve been nice to him. He\u2019s a competitor. You know, somebody was saying, \u201cIs he an enemy?\u201d No, he\u2019s not my enemy. \u201cIs he a friend?\u201d No, I don\u2019t know him well enough. But the couple of times that I\u2019ve gotten to meet him, we got along very well. You saw that.\n\n&gt; I hope we get along well. I think we get along well. But ultimately, he\u2019s a competitor. He\u2019s representing Russia. I\u2019m representing the United States. So in a sense, we\u2019re competitors. Not a question of friend or enemy. He\u2019s not my enemy. And hopefully, someday, maybe he\u2019ll be a friend. It could happen. But I \u2014 I just don\u2019t know him very well. I\u2019ve met him a couple of times.\n\nIn the same press conference, Trump also said \u201cI hope that we\u2019re going to be able to get along with Russia,\u201d \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll get along with the group that we\u2019re protecting against\u201d (a reference to NATO and Russia), \u201cI hope that we\u2019ll be able to get along\u201d (referring to himself and Putin), and \u201cI hope we get along well with Iraq.\u201d He also said about China, \u201cChina is going to be, I think, very successfully, ultimately, taken care of. I have a great respect for their President, as you know \u2014 President Xi [Jinping]. I spent two days there. It was among the most magical two days I\u2019ve ever lived.\u201d In other words, the United States and China can have a successful relationship because Xi showed him a good time.\n\nNo one would deny that personal relationships between leaders can be important in foreign relations. But Trump seems to have a view that those relations are almost entirely about personal chemistry, and the primary determinant of how the United States relates to allies, adversaries and every nation in between comes down only to whether he is able to \u201cget along\u201d with the leader in question. It\u2019s a view of foreign policy in which things such as national interests, domestic and global realities, and political circumstances don\u2019t matter. All that\u2019s important is whether, say, the United States and Russia could discover to their pleasant surprise that they both like H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and can\u2019t stand cilantro.\n\nPutin is hardly the only leader to whom Trump applies this principle. Since his meeting last month with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, he has responded to questions about the weakness of the agreement the two signed \u2014 in which Kim pledged only \u201cto work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d an utterly meaningless promise \u2014 by stressing how well the two got along. As evidence of Kim\u2019s intent to give up his nuclear weapons, Trump said yesterday, \u201cThat was an amazing \u2014 really, an amazing meeting, I thought. And I really think that we established a very good relationship.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is touting the fact that Kim sent him \u201ca very nice note\u201d about their meeting, as though that shows the fundamental dilemma at work \u2014 that the Kim regime believes its nuclear weapons are the ultimate guarantor of its survival, and therefore won\u2019t be willing to give them up for almost anything \u2014 can be swept aside if the two men are sufficiently chummy.\n\nI would argue this all has its roots in Trump\u2019s boundless faith in his own compelling personality, the belief that just as he can stroll into a room with a plumbing contractor and squeeze a favorable hourly rate out of him, he can do the same in international diplomacy. And in certain cases, Trump may make this kind of personalization of foreign relations a reality. Not because he can turn adversaries with their own interests into friends, but because he can alienate America\u2019s most critical allies by being a monumental jerk. That may indeed lead them to decide they have to step away from the cooperation that has strengthened both them and us over the last 70 years, because Trump is so erratic and hostile they don\u2019t trust him or think they can work with him.\n\nDonald Trump does indeed have a powerful personality, one that can affect the course of international relations.

Since the October Revolution aka communist revolution in Russia, the people and government in the US have been trying to silence and imprison socialists because the Bolsheviks are socialists. In reality, the socialists in the US has no association with the Bolsheviks and wanted to change US policies through normal, democratic means. Socialists choose to vote for the democrats to avoid silenced and ended up creating a massive political shift in the 2 major parties. Between the 20s and the 50s, the democrats had to do a balancing act to satisfy the new socialist members wanting reform and the rasist Southerners who want reform in the same places, except for race. For that period of time, the democrats and republicans were both progressive and regressive in their own ways. This ended with LBJ in the 60s ending many Jim Crow laws in the South and finally giving black people equal rights in some ways. The democrats past this point had become a progressive party, losing most of the southern support while the republicans toke the role of being the regressive party. After the cold war ended and Russia became a democracy, people in the US stopped fearing all socialists, socialists could finally start voice their opinions instead of just hoping the democrats would have a good candidate they can vote for. Socialists recent have been voicing their opinions because the democratic party, just like the republican party, is changing too. To capitalize on the fact many moderate republicans are upset with the new direction of the party, the democratic party is moving from its usual centrist position, to a center right position. This is upsetting many socialists because it means many of the reforms they wanted to see come though are now being put on hold so that they can get many moderate republicans to vote democrats. \n\nPersonally, the move the democratic party is making is really worrying. As much as I'd love to see the government filled with centrists over a slim right wing majority, if the democrats don't continue this new balancing act, the blue wave that's coming may split in two, way less effective waves that fail to capitalize on a fractured republican party, and may have the potential to end the nearly 200 year old party the same way the Whig party ended.","created_utc":1531528884,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"-Galahad-","body":"As I said I'm not here to argue whether or not Trump is bad.  This isn't the thread for it and this will be my last comment on the matter. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust to clear up the confusion on the separation of families.  Ice was created in 2003.  The \"Zero Tolerance Policy,\" which established the need to separate families, was created by the Trump administration. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore Trump, there were only specific cases which families were separated under, like if the parents were smuggling drugs or something else.  Trump's \"Zero Tolerance Policy\" made family separation universal to all cases of migrants seeking asylum and crossing the border. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/attorney-general-announces-zero-tolerance-policy-criminal-illegal-entry\n\nhttp:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/article\/2018\/jun\/06\/what-you-need-know-about-trump-administrations-zer\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Flores agreement does not in any way institute a policy for the separation of families as a requirement for those crossing the border.  The entire agreement only sets the standard if such cases were to occur, stating that children must be let go without delay and must be kept in a non-restrictive environment along with other living standards.  Just to reiterate, this agreement does in no way state that families must be separated for crossing the border.  As I said, before Trump's \"Zero Tolerance Policy\", separation only happened for specific cases, if the crime was something other than crossing the border.  Trump was the one who initiated the policy to separate all families.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeeking asylum is also not an illegal act and first time offenders for illegally crossing the border was considered a misdemeanor prior to Trump's amend of section 257(a) of the immigration and nationality act.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/USCODE-2011-title18\/html\/USCODE-2011-title18-partII-chap227.htm\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe precedent that crossing the border is now considered a felony was established by Trump. \n\nhttps:\/\/black.house.gov\/sites\/black.house.gov\/files\/documents\/BLACK_044_xml_Final.pdf\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen it comes to the trade-war with China and Canada, we're already seeing ramifications.  It's already hurting many American farmers and companies that import goods for their businesses and are either losing their jobs, or shipping out entirely to different countries.  Harley-Davidson, the famous American motorcycle manufacturer, is an example. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe existence of a wall directly impacts our economy.  Mexico isn't going to pay for it, despite Trump's outlandish promise that it would, and the cost to build and maintain the wall is astronomical and would exceed the federal budget, which is why there is no wall.  In order to build that wall and maintain it every year, it would require major tax increases and cuts to federal programs like social security. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDemocrats have tried working with Republicans throughout the entirety of Obama's presidency and the comprises they made always favored Republicans, even when Democrats held majority.  The current administration likes to blame Democrats for their own failures, but the truth is that Trump is in control of the House, Senate, and is about to be in control of the Supreme Court.  Republicans have a lockdown on all branches of government.  The reason Trump wasn't able to pass bills like banning Muslims and earlier drafts of their healthcare reform was because of Republicans not unifying.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen it comes to compromise, there were plenty of times Democrats tried to offer solutions that would meet in the middle and Republicans flat out refused.  An example would be a week after the Las Vegas shooting, Republicans proposed legislation that would eliminate restrictions on the purchase and use of gun-silencers and the Democrats were against the bill and tried to work things out, yet ultimately Republicans would not budge on the matter. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUniversal healthcare simply means that everyone's healthcare is covered.  The means of which you can achieve this are plenty.  Every modernized nation in the entire world is able to grant healthcare in one form or another to all of their citizens and yet the U.S., the highest GDP nation in the world, isn't able to guarantee healthcare.  Over 40k people die every year due to lack off healthcare and Trump's recent tax proposal would kick of an estimated 15-20 million individuals off of healthcare over the next decade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe argument for the minimum wage is simple.  Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s, meaning that the minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation.  The reason why you hear people asking for a $15 minimum wage is because that's what the minimum wage would be if it increased with inflation, at least for many states.

{"author":"mywan","body":"I've been predicting a left wing renaissance to occur about 2020 for over 4 years now. As you can see in my [first guilded post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bad_Cop_No_Donut\/comments\/226x9e\/half_of_americans_think_cops_not_held_accountable\/cgk8ph6\/). So I'm going to explain this from an entirely different perspective. One that explains why the Reagan revolution occurred for essentially the same reason.\n\nFirst you have to grasp a basic feature of economics. In order to maximize the economy at a particular productive capacity supply\/demand ratio must be in balance. If supply falls below demand you get a supply constrained economy, marked by high inflation. If demand falls below supply then we have a demand constrained economy marked by low inflation, and in extremes even negative inflation. Either of these constraints holds the economy below it's ideal productive capacity.\n\nNow, here's the important part. The money side of the supply\/demand ratio is the ratio between capital\/labor returns. [Here is the history of that ratio](http:\/\/www-tc.pbs.org\/prod-media\/newshour\/photos\/2012\/12\/06\/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG). The absolute dollar amount doesn't matter, only the ratio between the two. The balance in this ratio is the closest thing there is to a constant in economics. The center line on that graph is natural and not just a product of scaling.\n\nNow, to explain the Reagan revolution, look back at this ratio during the 1970s. Capital returns were at historic lows while labor returns were at historic highs. The drove demand to all times high relative to productive capacity. But with the high interest rates there wan't enough capital returns to make investing in more productivity profitable. But every time the Feds dropped interest rates enough to give capital an effective return the economy would take off like a bat out of hell. Because the demand was so high due to high labor returns and there was profit in meeting that demand. The Feds would see that economic growth was on fire and jack interest rates back up to cool it off. This killed the profit margin and the economy would go dead again. But the high demand continued to drive inflation rates which, if labor cost remained constant, would drive the labor return ratio down. But in those days most wages were effectively indexed to a significant degree with a regular cost of living increase.\n\nThis drove the right wing supply side ideology. Especially after it appeared to be so successful over the following decade. The rise of Third Way (corporate) democrats which Bill Clinton was the progenitor of, right wing libertarians, etc., all seen a huge surge in popularity. Meanwhile labor protections, antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, welfare, etc., etc., all got nerfed in the name of anti-regulation while Citizens United and similar rulings drove up the power of corporate interest. Even the anti-regulation sentiment doesn't apply when businesses want regulation to prevent new business competition from moving in on their territory. That only applies to screwing over consumers. With the supply side as king cities began criminalizing homelessness, police have been tacitly granted massively increased power to suppress the working class, via case law, with qualified immunity protecting them from rights violations, etc., etc. \n\n***\n\nSo why the left wing renaissance? Look at that same graph today. Labor returns, as a ratio total returns, are at all time historic lows. Year over year economic growth is at historic lows. Inflation rates at historic lows. World [overproduction](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overproduction) is at historic highs due to wage returns relative to cost not being sufficient to consume that much productive capacity. [Falling productivity](http:\/\/time.com\/4464743\/productivity-decline\/) as the wealthy can afford to hire cheap labor labor to engage in monopolistic behavior to grow instead of increasing production that there is not enough labor returns to sell that productivity increase. And buy politicians to continue suppressing labor even more. Meanwhile the push for government spying in ways that would haver been intolerable to my parents generation (I'm old) is the norm. Police brutality has been normalized. Sure extensive corrupt police practices existed in the past. But the difference is they used to do it under the table. Now they openly brag about practices to the media that would have got them locked up in the past. It's not just more people with cameras making it more visible, even if that has some effect, these corrupt practices are now something they take pride in politically to a degree unheard of in the past. \n\nSo basically, in spite of the modestly growing wealth of the nation as a whole, the majority of the working class has had zero, and even negative, growth. And as this freezing out of economic gains to the working class continues the freeze moves further and further up the income chain. Even [capital investors are getting frozen out of returns (PDF)](https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/sites\/gsb\/files\/jmp_simcha-barkai.pdf). The only winners are the capital owners, doing stock buybacks of their own stock at rapidly increasing rates. Something that the Trump tax cuts are being used to accelerate even faster.\n\n***\n\nEven the Trump republicans, who scare the shit out of traditional republicans, are voting the way they are because they know they are being screwed. The left and right, and factions therein, just disagree on how. Not on the fact that it's happening. So is it government regulation? No. Because if it was it would hurt capital returns just as much as it does labor returns. But it's [obviously not](http:\/\/www-tc.pbs.org\/prod-media\/newshour\/photos\/2012\/12\/06\/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG). Is it free trade? Well no. Otherwise it would hurt US corporate interest just as hard as labor. But it's [obviously not](http:\/\/www-tc.pbs.org\/prod-media\/newshour\/photos\/2012\/12\/06\/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG). So republicans, and Third Way (corporate) democrats to a lesser degree, are pushing policies that take money out of your paycheck. But instead of taking it in taxes it's going your bosses boss. The capital owner, not investors. And a significant part of that isn't being reinvested. It's being shipped off into offshore account protected from the IRS. Like what the Panama papers illustrated. So when you spend a dollar less and less of that dollar is going pay the cost of production, and more and more is laundered through offshore accounts never to be seen again. Like a high tech Scrooge McDuck vault guarded by armies of lawyers. \n\nIs Trump helping? No. Everything he's doing either has nothing to do with the problem or he is making it worse. He even admits it:\n\n&gt;CARLSON: This bill has as one of its centerpieces a tax-cut for investors that would primarily benefit people making over $250,000 a year. They\u2019ve already done pretty well in the past ten years, as you know.\n\n&gt;&gt;TRUMP: Yeah.\n\n&gt;CARLSON: A Bloomberg analysis showed that counties that voted for you\u200a\u2014\u200amiddle-class and working-class counties\u200a\u2014\u200awould do far less well under this bill \u2014\n\n&gt;&gt;TRUMP: Yeah. Oh, I know.\n\nBecause the republicans believe that increasing capital returns will increase growth. But it will not. Because labor isn't getting enough the profit from production for there to be enough demand to buy more production from that growth. So they blame it on high labor cost instead, so they can push to take more profit by keeping more of your money so you can afford even less. They then blame it on global trade so they can keep more of your money so you can afford even less. Even though it's [going to them](http:\/\/www-tc.pbs.org\/prod-media\/newshour\/photos\/2012\/12\/06\/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG) and not to those other nations. They then blame it on regulations so they can gut the regulations that prevent them from taking more of your money. Then they tell you that your labor is not worth that much because they have taken so much of your money that the market demand isn't high enough to support your job at your pay level, and take more of your money. Then they tell you that because of the lack of well paying job opportunities created by the lack of demand resulting from taking your money for free that it's the illegal aliens that are taking those jobs. But in reality they just took those jobs straight out of your paycheck for free and into offshore accounts. Because without that money in your paycheck you can't buy things with money you don't have. And when you can't buy those things they can't profit paying people to make the things you can't buy. Because they already took your money for free. And then roll their eyes at social democrats and say they just want everything for free. We'll they already [took it from you for free](http:\/\/www-tc.pbs.org\/prod-media\/newshour\/photos\/2012\/12\/06\/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG), so what's the difference?\n\nI don't want a pure socialism. There's a limit, like in the 1970s, to what labor can take without damaging the economy. But there is also a limit to what capital can keep without damaging the economy. And we are way past the level that is damaging to the economy.\n","created_utc":1531536570,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Though still much higher than the general population, this is very significant. The problem is that it is being misrepresented\u2014\"transitioning and GCS increases suicide rates by almost 5 times!\" This is because they're comparing it to the general population, not to the overall transgender population.\n\nThis paragraph in particular seems highly relevant:\n\n\"For the purpose of evaluating whether sex reassignment is an effective treatment for gender dysphoria, it is reasonable to compare reported gender dysphoria pre and post treatment. Such studies have been conducted either prospectively[7], [12] or retrospectively,[5], [6], [9], [22], [25], [26], [29], [38] and suggest that sex reassignment of transsexual persons improves quality of life and gender dysphoria.\"\n\nIn other words, it helps.

How stupid do you think he can be?\nAnd why are you bothering to mention my own intelligence.  Would that be a personal attack, waldrop02?\n\nBut anyway, here:\n\n&gt; **What is Donald Trump's IQ? Something's wrong, but it's not lack of smarts**\n\n&gt; Donald Trump, despite speaking to the nation at a 4th grade reading level, is poised to become one of the smartest American Presidents, ever, based on his college admissions and lifetime of success in highly competitive businesses, politics included. Trump\u2019s first college was Fordham University, a Jesuit school in the Bronx. After two years at Fordham, a liberal hotbed, he transferred to the posher Ivy League Penn. Though SAT test scoring has changed several times since Trump was examined, the relationship between high school GPAs and test scores, vis-a-vis college admissions, probably, hasn\u2019t. Both universities require GPAs of between 3.7 and 3.8, on a scale of 4, and SATs ranging between a Fordham low of 1400, and a Penn high of 1590, based on current admission profiles. Both universities are rated as \u201csomewhat selective\u201d and have, approximately, the same acceptance rates, though Penn takes transfer students with as low as a 2.0 GPA. In other words, you need at least a B+ average, more or less, to get into both schools but only a C- to transfer to Penn from somewhere else. Trump graduated from Penn State with a B.S. in Anthropology and Economics. He, also, took business courses while a student even if he isn\u2019t, exactly, a Wharton grad.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bayoubuzz.com\/bb\/item\/1062224-trump-no-einstein-iq-but-smarter-than-the-average-president\n\nThat is, SATs of at least 1400.","created_utc":1531608289,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

They're willingly giving in to a strongman, and it's not even going well for them because this GOP Congress really hasn't done much. They've failed to repeal Obamacare three times; they've had, like, double-digit infrastructure weeks that amounted to nothing; House Republicans have spent months hobbling together an immigration bill, but don't have the votes for literally any kind of compromise between the Freedom Caucus and the GOP moderates. Much of the GOP's Congressional problems stem from Trump not doing his homework and from Trump changing his mind every time he talks to someone. Republican's can't settle on a goal post for their legislative agenda because Trump is always moving it based on petty squabbles with his underlings' media appearances and Fox News opinionators. They should really drop Trump, but they just can't seem to. It begs the question why. Besides the Democratic Party, Russia also hacked into the Republican Party, yet didn't release anything to WikiLeaks. Who knows how many Republicans are being blackmailed with emails they don't want published. Just a thought. But Trump himself is of course a fascist in a plethora or ways. Just look at any side-by-side comparison of Mussolini that comes up in the first 10 pages of a Google search. And then Hitler. Trump is executing intentionally divisive and partisan policy. To the point that his convenient idiocy does not deserve forgiveness. But he is fucking stupid and hates experts and doesn't listen to any of them, and doesn't even read his national security briefings even when they're shorted to little paragraphs on a single page with his name included throughout. So just imagine how fascist he could become if he exerted himself more intellectually than merely telling everyone around him constantly that he's a genius.

I have many disagreements on issues, but over all I think we could work well together if we are both willing to compromise on certain issues. \n\nThe problem I have with Libertarian philosophy is that I feel like in order implement their ideas toward a completely free market, this country would have to start from scratch. I just can't see a way to grant the kind of free market they're talking about with the size of the corporate and government power we're currently working with. That being said, I can see a path for incremental advances in personal liberty that could get them on board with a more Liberal stance in the political arena. \n\nOne such issue I think Liberals need to get on board with the Libertarians on, is guns. I'm not saying put one in every home, but I am saying to stop working toward abolition. I get that we have a gun problem in this country, but can you honestly say that the problem can be legislated away? If so tell me I'm wrong and I'll talk about it, but I just don't see a way around the argument that people will absolutely break the law to maintain their second amendment rights or just to kill some sad motherfucker, we're fucked up that way in this country. I think that with that compromise we could get them to pivot left on abortion. Right now they're torn on abortion. They believe in personal liberty, but can't justify abortion because of the Non Aggression Principal (NAP). Some Libertarians feel it violates NAP because terminating a pregnancy can be considered an aggression toward the unborn child. I can understand that, but I can't take away a woman right to personal liberty.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that as Liberals we have a lot in common with Libertarians. We should invite them to dinner as often as possible and talk with them. Both philosophies have extremists, but extremists don't represent us all and are bad for elections.

{"author":"lead999x","body":"What you're saying is just not true. I'm an economic analyst so I do have some background in this topic. \n\nIncome inequality does exist and it is cause by misaligned wage distributions in the private sector. In the past it used to be because the wealthy made money via investments which grow exponentially as compared to wages which accrue linearly(and are taxed higher since the income tax is progressive while the capital gains tax is a flat 15%). This is still the case but nowadays compensation disparities are the single largest reason for wealth inequality. Executives get paid large salaries, large bonuses, and they get securities which make them money over time and derivative securities which such as stock options which are levered and thus can accrue (or lose) value very fast and even if they do lose their entire value it's not like those executives paid for them anyway. So it's a win-draw scenario.\n\nMeanwhile your average worker gets fleeced because in labor markets which aren't monopolistic like the executive labor market, the temporary monopsony afforded to the buyers of labor i.e. employers allows them significant market power to negotiate wages that are lower than the true value of the labor being purchased (determined by the total factor productivity of the labor in question, but I'll spare you the lecture in factor markets theory; it's not for laymen). \n\nYour assertion that rich people necessarily produce value for millions of people is laughable. There are hedge fund managers who make insane amounts of money by doing little more than speculating in the derivatives markets. There are investment bankers who merely move money and securities around and make bank doing so. There are the Martin Shkerlis of the world who make money by jacking up the prices on products for which a nearly perfectly inelastic demand exists (price gouging, which is technically illegal but often not enforced) due to medical necessity, simply because they can and no one will stop them. Most industries today are oligopolies and let me tell you that is no accident. It is the result of a careful and deliberate gerrymandering of the private sector in much the same way as has been done in the public sector. \n\nSo the idea that wealth is only ever begotten through the production of value is inarguably false. And this is before we get into the pedantry about percieved and tangible value. \n\nIf you wish to research this topic further I have a plethora of books I can recommend, some of which were recommended to me by the esteemed scholars under whom I studied in the course of my undergraduate education in economics and philosophy.

{"author":"SwampShillin","body":"Thanks for the thoughtful response. At least you're willing to lay out your reasons for why you feel the left has gone off the rails. I appreciate your willingness to have the discussion. Allow me to just push back on a few things...\n\nAt the outset, part of the problem I see with political dialogue in this country is that we often generalize and see things through groups rather than individuals. I think you and I could agree that there is a spectrum of people who might be characterized as or identify as 'on the left'.... some more extreme than others. And some people who might not fit so neatly into any category. By the nature of our political system, our politics gets turned into something like a team sport where we feel like we have to pick a side... but I think that in reality, most of us are more complex and have a mixture of beliefs\/sympathies that might be harder to classify.\n\nSo, when we talk about the left, I think it's important to remember we're generalizing. I consider myself to be on the left but don't agree with most of the things you have a problem with. I don't think that all Trump supporters are fascists or fascist sympathizers. I don't think that the development of safe spaces or deplatforming on campuses is a good thing... although I have to say that I do think that some of the hype has been overblown. Campuses have always been a bit crazy, at least going back to the 60's, but I work on a college campus and don't actually see any of the things that get so much attention in the news.\n\n&gt; The left thinks that anyone who is not white is automatically oppressed and deserves some kind of special privilege.\n\nI think this is a topic that is fiercely debated as well... things like affirmative action are certainly more popular on the left but the recent Harvard discrimination case brought by Asian students is showing the downside of policies like that. I think they are all things worthy of discussion but I don't agree with the statement that anyone who is not white necessarily deserve special privileges.\n\n&gt; And with the increasing number of black people getting shot, the left thinks this has to do with some sort of \"racism\" when the statistics show that black people commit more crime on average.\n\nDo the statistics show that? Are you saying that police are shooting more black people or shooting them at a higher rate than they used to? I'm not aware of those statistics.\n\n&gt; The absolute worst part is we almost got a \"Democratic\" Socialist elected!\n\nAre you talking about Bernie? What policies of Bernie's did you have the biggest problem with? I didn't agree with all of his proposals but I certainly don't think he was trying to usher in a socialist revolution or anything. The increases in government programs that he was proposing were things like Medicare for all, that are standard in most developed countries.\n\n&gt; free handouts from the government because apparently the rich aren't paying their \"fair share\" of taxes which is absolute nonsense because the rich pay the highest taxes in most states where some people don't even pay anything at all.\n\nWell, don't you think that someone could hypothetically pay \"the highest taxes\" *and* not be paying their fair share? Do you think that the amount of wealth that has accrued at the top of the economic distribution scale is commensurate with how much they deserve? I have no problem with certain people being rich if they deserve it but I think that the problem is our system allows for certain people to become astronomically rich without adding much to the economy... and I don't have a problem with taxing things like capital gains and offshoring of profits.\n\nWhat were the reasons you used to consider yourself a Liberal, if I might ask?","created_utc":1531832785,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Phunkometer","body":"As someone who was a staunch conservative until I was about 26 or so (I then dabbled in libertarianism for a short time before doing a full 180 and becoming a social democrat), I can confidently say I went left because everything about the right turned out to be patently untrue. Well, most things.\n\nI used to by into the anti illegal immigration rhetoric, as in I actually believed illegal immigrants were causing mayhem across the country. But it\u2019s just simply not true. Yes, we need immigration reform, but this idea that we need ICE agents to maraud around the country gathering these people up for deportation is just silly and a massive waste of money and resources. Not to mention illegal immigrants profoundly affect our economy in a good way. That\u2019s just a fact that can\u2019t be argued. In addition, there\u2019s this false narrative that illegal immigrants don\u2019t pay taxes, but they do. They can\u2019t *file* their taxes, so they don\u2019t get a refund, but they are absolutely paying taxes. They also aren\u2019t burdening our welfare system like is often claimed.\n\nTax cuts is another area I used to lean right on and then over time learned I was completely wrong about. Tax cuts on the rich have always had an overall negative effect on the economy as well as the middle and lower classes. What amazes me is the results are all a matter of data that is available for anyone to find and read, yet people still don\u2019t believe what they read\n\nI had also bought into the lies told about things like socialized medicine, affordable college tuition, etc. I believed the lies about waiting periods, low quality care, low quality of life, and so forth. \n\nOn top of all that stuff, the right is just flat out wrong when it comes to social issues. Even at my most conservative I was still very socially liberal; I supported gay marriage, was pro-choice on abortion (even though personally I dislike abortion, and still do today, but it\u2019s none of my business), and I was very supportive of other races, ethnicities, religions and what have you. I abhorred racism, sexism, etc... But the conservatives of today are still on the wrong side of these social issues and as a result essentially want to restrict rights when they say they want the government out of our lives.  These were things I always got into arguments with my fellow conservatives and was often ridiculed within my own party.\n\nThe thing that pushed me away from the Republican Party was how toxic most republicans were after Obama got elected in 2008. At the time I disagreed with almost every policy Obama had and I voted for McCain, but all that crap about Obama being a Kenyan Muslim terrorist who aimed to destroy America made me embarrassed to call myself a republican, thus my exodus and brief stint with libertarianism.\n\nBut what ultimately made me go left, was I got tired of getting into arguments with my liberal friends and not actually having facts to support my argument. It was them I realized that most of what republicans believe is rooted in lies and half truths.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not to say democrats are the gold standard of honesty and integrity, because they\u2019re not, but most of the policies and world views are rooted in fact.","created_utc":1531834534,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"pdxf","body":"Yeah, we definitely are living in our own worlds unfortunately, and I'm not entirely sure what can be done about it. Hopefully we can find some way forward. I would have hoped, as our populations have diverged between urban and rural, that the internet could have bridged the gap, but it would seem as though the opposite has happened.\n\nA couple quick thoughts:\nI don't think as a liberal you need to only focus on the caring aspect. I think that may play a somewhat large part for many which is fine, but for me I think a large part of why I'm liberal is more for the economic aspects. For instance, I think there are several reasons why universal health care would be good for small business owners, entrepeneurs, and thus the economy as a whole. The repeal of net-neutrality, which the republicans just repealed, could have pretty profound negative impacts on small startups and small web-based businesses (and their employees) -- and really technological advancement as a whole moving forward. I actually think that for many issues, there is an answer that is both caring and good for economic\/big picture reasons.\n \nI think a large part of the problem is that none of us really know. For instance, I really do think providing health care to everyone is a good thing for a country economically, and you probably think the opposite. We can both dig up data to support our conclusions, but that doesn't really seem to get us anywhere. I think in a lot of cases, we just really don't know. So we can just argue about it forever. I'm looking forward to the day when we can plug all of this into a computer, run some simulations, and hopefully get some real data to inform our policies (I would seriously love it if there were more data-driven processes for implementing policy).  \n\nAnyways, good discussion -- I appreciate your thoughts. I actually really like talking about how we run our society, and it's nice to have a good, level-headed discussion in these times!\n\n\n ","created_utc":1532032632,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"COPCO2","body":"Political topics are cyclical, and every new debate is basically a rehash of decades old positions with new personalities at the helm.\n\nSo you can review the hot button issues and do a little research on their history and be pretty well prepared for any new developments.  You'll also be able to predict pretty accurately which candidates and party supports what before you even read up on them.  That saves a lot of time.\n\nI would start with a current story you find interesting and research it's history on Wikipedia.  Always read the criticisms sections for better context, and then dive into the source if you want to know more.\n\nBut the modern political positions began in the 1960s, with civil rights, abortion, the southern strategy and were pretty well cemented into place in 1980 when Reagan and the neoconservative movement came to power.  Clinton then made the democrats what they are today - pro trade and business - in 1992, and every election between then and now has had similar topics of debate.\n\nTrump is interesting because he breaks with the neocons in some ways, but is a very typical conservative president in other ways.  A lot of his policies are straight out of the playbook of the far right, but his bluster and personality make it seem new.\n\nFor more modern issues, read up on trade and economic policy, because this is where the parties have reversed over the last 35 years.  Democrats were once the pro-labor, middle class union supporting, tariff and protectionist party until Clinton.  And Republicans were once the pro-business, free-trade globalists until Trump.  NAFTA, commonly associated with Clinton, actually first began under Reagan.  Republicans were once staunchly anti-Russia in all forms and insulted Democrats by calling them commies because it linked them to the  Communist Soviet Union, our greatest enemy for decades....how the times have changed.\n\nSo I see politics as issues with different personalities pushing for them, not the other way around.  Because the issues remain pretty unchanged from election to election, until major reversals happen, which makes everything interesting.","created_utc":1532167119,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"ReadTheArticleBitch","body":"**Republicans are telling Democrats to move right. It\u2019s dreadful advice.**\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s steady move to the left in recent times, particularly in the past year and a half, is one of the most important developments of this era in American politics. And inevitably, the concern trolls are out, telling the party that it will waste an opportunity if it goes too far to the left.\n\nFor instance, here\u2019s former Republican James B. Comey, sharing his political insights about what does and doesn\u2019t affect elections:\n\nHere\u2019s Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, telling liberals that they\u2019ll never beat President Trump with a bunch of leftist policy ideas. And it\u2019s not just Republicans; the group Third Way held a gathering of moderate Democrats so that they could wring their hands about where the party is going. \u201cThe Democrats, in my opinion, would make a big mistake if they decide to run a base election and just say, \u2018Our base is bigger than your base,\u2019 \u201d said former New Orleans mayor and possible presidential candidate Mitch Landrieu.\n\nWhy would that be a mistake? It worked for Trump, didn\u2019t it? And the Democratic base is\u00a0bigger than the Republican base; the problem is their members don\u2019t turn out often enough.\n\nBut let\u2019s put that aside for a moment. There\u2019s a misconception at the heart of this debate, one that says that this is nothing more than an argument over whether persuasion or mobilization \u2014 trying to convert those who aren\u2019t already supporting you or trying to get your own supporters to the polls \u2014 is more worthwhile. The balance between those two strategies is an important part of this (and every) election. But when we frame the choice between persuasion and mobilization as a debate about ideology, we make a fundamental mistake: believing that the way to persuade voters who aren\u2019t already supporting you is to moderate your positions on issues.\n\nWhile that may seem perfectly logical if you\u2019re a political junkie, in the real world it seldom works. The reason is that most voters don\u2019t think in ideological terms. They aren\u2019t maintaining a running tally of positions candidates have taken, then assigning each candidate a score (plus 1 for her positions on abortion and health care, minus one for her position on NAFTA), then seeing which candidate\u2019s total comes closest to the ideological score they\u2019ve assigned themselves. That\u2019s just not how voters make decisions.\n\nNobody understands this better than Republicans. After all, it\u2019s the reason they can keep winning elections despite the fact that most of the things they want to do are absurdly unpopular. Tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, stopping any increase in the minimum wage, taking away protections for people with preexisting conditions, opposing even universal background checks for gun purchases? These are not popular ideas. Yet Republicans don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about whether they\u2019re moving too far to the right, because they find ways, like stoking culture war issues and playing on racial resentment, that push them over the finish line.\n\nWhat the concern trolls are advocating is that Democrats go back to being afraid of their own shadows the way they were for so long, convincing themselves that the American public is extremely conservative and if they don\u2019t become more like Republicans then they have no hope of winning. It\u2019s a belief shared by pretty much every losing Democratic presidential candidate for the past few decades; all of them radiated a sense of insecurity, apologizing for their beliefs and those of their party. It\u2019s something Republicans never do.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t some Republicans out there who can be persuaded to vote for a Democrat for Congress this year or a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. But they aren\u2019t going to be won over by candidates who say, \u201cI\u2019m kinda not too liberal, so how about it?\u201d They want candidates who speak to their concerns and who aren\u2019t ashamed of their own views \u2014 views, by the way, that are far more popular than moderate Democrats and Republicans would like to admit. We can have a debate about the practical challenges of implementing \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d for instance, but the idea is hugely appealing, even to many Republicans.\n\nAren\u2019t there places where \u201cHe\u2019s a Nancy Pelosi Democrat!\u201d can still be a potent attack? Maybe \u2014 even if the idea that screaming about Pelosi changes anyone\u2019s mind has long been asserted but never demonstrated. But if you think conservatives dislike Pelosi because they\u2019ve carefully assessed her issue positions and decided that she\u2019s more liberal than they are, you don\u2019t know much about how politics works. For those who eagerly imbibe regular diatribes about her from Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity, Pelosi is a symbol, not an ideology. She represents women who tell men what to do and snooty coastal elites, not a collection of positions on issues.\n\nNow let\u2019s address the question of mobilization. Right now, the Democratic Party is benefiting from a huge wave of enthusiasm, especially from liberals, many of them young people who are tired of the timid politics that has characterized the party for so long. Democrats\u2019 biggest problem in midterm elections is always that the Republican base \u2014 older, wealthier, whiter \u2014 tends to turn out at higher rates than the Democratic base in off years. If Democrats are going to win this year, they have to ride that new energy. And nothing would puncture it quicker than the party making a collective decision that what it really needs is the more tentative, apologetic strategy that has failed so often in the past.\n\n\u270c cool people read before commenting \u270c","created_utc":1532373198,"score":9,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Everything else you've stated focuses on positions that, if held at all, are held by an incredibly tiny minority of conservative thinkers or doers.\n\nAre you serious? It's no wonder you have such a hard time avoiding equating two completely different things. You have no idea what it is you're trying to describe. That is exactly what Donald Trump has been doing since he got into office. Scott Pruitt has done all he can to make it easier to contaminate natural resources and the environment, from rolling back bans on pesticides that cause fetal nerve damage, to rolling back fuel efficiency standards, and allowing agricultural companies to use incredibly toxic fertilizer near water systems. They're trying to get rid of the clean power plan that would limit the amount of CO2 by fossil fuel power providers and withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. Brett Kavanaugh is poised to help the conservative SCOTUS strike down abortion, Donald Trump has been spewing racist rhetoric and hate crimes spiked in the wake of his election. He called the Nazi side of a Nazi rally\/counter protest \"very good people,\" he's started an escalating trade war with NATO countries, ridiculed them repeatedly, and called them America's \"foes.\" He signed a tax bill that gives a massive cut to the wealthiest strata of society and corporations, while giving a miniscule tax cut to middle class and poorer Americans (some are even getting a tax increase) and is using the resulting deficits as an excuse to cut social welfare benefits like food stamps and public housing to poor people. He's limited advertising for ACA enrollment, shortened the enrollment window, and refused to enforce the individual mandate, resulting in millions of fewer insured people, and done everything he can to cut Medicaid. And the Republican dominated congress, at the behest of its base, is actively supporting these policies. \n\nOnly someone completely clueless about what the Republican lead government is doing could say something as stupid as American discourse is as contentious as it is because of guilt on both sides. Congratulations. Civil discourse is only aided in its implacability by idiots like you who completely misread the situation. \"Hurr-durr.\" How original. At least come up with original faux-mouth breather mischaracterizations. You'd seem a lot less banal.\n\n&gt;Those are not mainstream US-conservative positions and your portrayal of them as such is evidence that you have no idea why conservatives think like they do, only that you are absolutely against the boogeyman-like portrayal of conservative positions as presented by hard-left media outlets (like Slate, AJ+, and ThinkProgress, etc. Not like NBC, MSNBC, ABC, CNN, WaPo etc.)\n\nExcept that's exactly the agenda the conservative lead gov't has enacted, plenty of which you can read in outlets like WaPo and the NYT, both of which I have subscriptions to. So you've completed a troubling trifecta here. Namely that you don't understand what is occurring on one side of the political divide, how the people you're concerned about come by the information they receive, and what the outlets even you admit are credible are saying. It's like you're trying to make yourself look foolish.\n\n&gt;I reached out to conservatives (albeit college educated ones, I live in a educated bubble) because I thought there was no way that they were that demented. Turns out they're not; they're portrayal is one of demented positions but that kind of portrayal is false, as far as it being an accurate reflection of the values of the conservatives I had to chance to speak with.\n\nThat's cute, in spite of the vicious and escalating right wing rhetoric, the emergence of rebranded white supremacy known as the alt-right, the abhorrent policy of the conservative government, and the implacable base that supports all of the above, we should all take a breather and calmly find a middle ground between our equally extreme viewpoints, because we have you to thank for proving this is a mutual problem, thanks to your supposed in depth research into the matter with a few conservatives with bachelors degrees. Thanks Dr. Hawking, brilliant discovery there.\n\n&gt;I implore you to reach out and speak with those whom you believe you disagree with entirely.\n\nI implore you to stop being pretentious to satisfy a need to feel like you're above it all and have a superior viewpoint to those of us very much involved in the fracas political discourse has become, thanks entirely to one side. \n\n&gt;You may disagree on some things but I doubt you will find them to be the monsters you currently believe them to be\n\nWe disagree on many things, mostly because they are monsters. For someone who decries making assumptions, you sure do it a lot yourself. Like the assumption about who I've talked to, and the vitriolic nastiness I've encountered.\n\n&gt;I might be wrong.\n\nYou are.\n\n&gt;If so, I am sorry.\n\nYou should be.\n\n&gt;But so far my outreach has yet to introduce me to anyone who has terribly monstrous thoughts.\n\nWho gives a shit?

After all, it\u2019s the reason they can keep winning elections despite the fact that most of the things they want to do are absurdly unpopular. Tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, stopping any increase in the minimum wage, taking away protections for people with preexisting conditions, opposing even universal background checks for gun purchases? **These are not popular ideas. Yet Republicans don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about whether they\u2019re moving too far to the right, because they find ways, like stoking culture war issues and playing on racial resentment, that push them over the finish line.** \\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now let\u2019s address the question of mobilization. Right now, the Democratic Party is benefiting from a huge wave of enthusiasm, especially from liberals, many of them young people who are tired of the timid politics that has characterized the party for so long. Democrats\u2019 biggest problem in midterm elections is always that the Republican base \u2014 older, wealthier, whiter \u2014 tends to turn out at higher rates than the Democratic base in off years. If Democrats are going to win this year, they have to ride that new energy. **And nothing would puncture it quicker than the party making a collective decision that what it really needs is the more tentative, apologetic strategy that has failed so often in the past.**\n\nThe writer hit the nail right on the head.

{"author":"ElGrandeRojo2018","body":"Well, the key factor to examine here is that, liberalism is not failing eeverywhere. It is, in fact, only failing in America, as well as other nations that are similar to America. \n\nFor example,  just like the US was a developing country fairly recently (the 1800s is laughably recent), so too were  many African countries also recently in the development stage, or still in it.  Oddly enough, African countries are the most conservative in the world, and just like the USA, also tend to share the issue of being very spread apart and having more of a focus on rural tribal politics, instead of an urban culture. \n\nThe city for the American is not what the city is for the European. I'm sorry but, Europe has been rolling with an advanced urban culture for literally thousands of years now. America was set up in the most vicious fashion imaginable in the 15-1800s. When Europe was experiencing a Renaissance with the likes of DaVinci, Galileo and others, the Americans were literally birds breaking out of a hatched egg. \n\nAmerican conservatism isn't a sign of some advancement on America's part. That is made painfully clear the moment one leaves behind Kaintuck and begins to study global politics. America is nothing more than a former colony of Europe, which  is now struggling to get to the highly urbanized place which Europe, its father, has already been at , for hundreds of years now.  That's literally all it is. \n\nMy explanation here isn't a condemnation of the American culture. It's actually a justification for why it is the way it is. With the passage of time, the USA wil catch up with its father Europe, and then it will look very different. Until that day, my suggestion is that one should try and get out to those Big Sky states  like Montana and Wyoming as soon as possible. It's the beautiful and quiet outskirts of human civiliation out there, and its a very fine thing to see, before it is gone. And just like its gone in Europe, it will be gone here one day too. \n\nLiberalism brings order and organization; it also brings the end of the \"mountain men\". \n\n","created_utc":1532437815,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"ReadTheArticleBitch","body":"**Why a (now-deleted) op-ed about replacing libraries with Amazon blew up the internet**\n\nTo suggest that Amazon -- or any other single company -- could replace the rich knowledge local libraries have about their patrons' needs is insulting. To minimize and dismiss the significant role of public libraries -- historically and today -- in combating inequality and fostering democracy is simply ignorant.\n\nLibraries are one of the last remaining civic spaces open to the public. They provide vital free services and are storehouses of information. In addition to allowing patrons to check out paper books (including large print and out of print), ebooks, audiobooks, movies and music at no cost, libraries also offer free internet access, career centers and community programming. Additionally, they allow nonprofit agencies and organizations to use their rooms as meeting spaces.\n\nIn many communities, librarians are on the front lines helping those who otherwise might slip through the cracks. At a time when struggling Americans are falling deeper into poverty and America's wealth gap is growing, public libraries remain one of the only places where vulnerable people can connect with the resources to improve their lives.\n\nSuggesting that Amazon, or any other commercial entity, replace libraries, where staffers have degrees in library science and are trained to assist patrons, doesn't make sense for a society that cares about knowledge. When Mourdoukoutas suggests that libraries \"don't have the same value they used to\" because of places like Starbucks, he fundamentally misrepresents the role of the library in a community. The two locations aren't in competition for people's attention or time; I'm pretty sure even little kids know that a coffeeshop is where you go if you want to eat or drink or meet up, and a library is where you go if you want to get books or movies or games. Even those aren't absolutes, as some libraries offer cafes and some people use both as places to caffeinate and get work done.\n\nHe also claims digital technology has \"turned physical books into collector's items.\" If that were the case, why is the holds section at my local library full every time I visit? Just because Mourdoukoutas may not read print books or visit his library doesn't mean that plenty of other people aren't; in fact, sales of print books rose in 2017, so all library closings would do is keep them the province of those with disposable income.\n\nMourdoukoutas' main point seems to be that cutting out libraries would save taxpayers money; he cited his own $495 tax bill on Twitter. This way of thinking aligns with President Trump's bid to cut library funding in the 2019 fiscal budget. This myopic view of the value of libraries privileges the wealthy and erases the great contributions trained library staff provide, especially to children, seniors and job seekers.\n\nLibraries offer a free, relaxed space where you can sit, read, play and learn, as well as access information. They aren't seeking to sell you anything; instead, they want to enrich your mind. By doing so, they help enrich our society as a whole.\n\nHistorically, many libraries have been a space of empowerment for immigrants, women, and people of color. More recently, Carla Hayden, now the Librarian of Congress, kept a branch of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library open during the outcry following the death of Freddie Gray. As Hayden told American Libraries Magazine in 2015, \"The library has been the community's anchor. It's the heart of the community at good times and bad times.\"\n\nIf we care about children's education enough to fund schools, we should care equally about library funding. We should value the importance of providing internet access for those who can't afford it, reading skills and entertainment for children and other vital programs and services libraries offer.\n\nThis season is a particularly crucial time for libraries when it comes to helping children combat the \"summer slide,\" in which kids who don't keep up with their reading fall far behind their peers who do. According to the American Library Association, 95% of libraries offer summer reading programs to keep kids' knowledge on track so they're prepared when they head back to school.\n\nThese aren't just rote, dry encouragements to \"read more\" either. In Bristol, Virginia, children go on field trips to local caverns and mines at part of the Summer Reading Program. The children's librarian was able to see the impact of those trips when all the library's gem and mineral books were checked out around the same time. Other ways they've engaged children with reading include bringing 100 djembe drums into the library, as well as a presentation featuring serpents and other reptiles. While Amazon may be the \"everything store,\" I can see no reason why their bookstores would ever want to offer these types of programming.\n\nLibraries also offer essential resources to their patrons, from technology workshops to career and resume workshops, which help them become productive members of society. Children can practice reading to dogs and attend a journal making event or anime club -- these are just a few of thousands of such events across the country.\n\nLibraries don't just wait for patrons to come to them, either; they deliver services to people such as seniors who may not be able to come into the library. The Westerville, Ohio Outreach Program Librarian goes to senior living facilities and centers to run trainings and play interactive games. These aren't services that an algorithm can generate or execute, because they aren't focused on sales data, but human needs.\n\nAmanda Winkler, a library clerk in a rural library outside of Lincoln, Nebraska, told me that many of her library's patrons have needs \"that are not met by the services provided by companies like Amazon. In the past we have offered a range of adult classes from technology usage and yoga to cooking and American Sign Language (ASL). These have always been free and open to the public for anyone to attend.\"\n\nWinkler also noted that library collections may include local and state history archives, telescopes, microscopes, mobile devices, cooking utensils and tools that can be checked out, and even Makerspaces with sewing machines or screen printing.\n\nIn response to Mourdoukoutas, EveryLibrary elaborated on other assistance libraries provide: \"Veterans returning from overseas can attend programs to help them gain access to critical services. Small business owners and entrepreneurs can access global market databases like Gale Business Insights and use ReferenceUSA and AtoZ Databases to find new leads. \"\n\nLet's not forget about data privacy. As a customer, I have no problem with Amazon upselling me items they think I may be interested in. I shop from them knowing full well that my sales data may be used to target me for future purchases. But US libraries are held to a higher standard. According to the ALA, \"Libraries, librarians, and library workers have an ethical obligation, expressed in the ALA Code of Ethics, to preserve users' right to privacy and prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of users' personally identifiable information or the data associated with their use of the library's resources.\"\n\nThis is just another reason, among very many, to reject this ludicrous idea from Mr. Mourdoukoutas.\n\n\u270c cool people read before commenting \u270c","created_utc":1532449528,"score":58,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

If you are aware of how easy it is to make your own ammunition it hardly seems like a deterant that will stop any crime and only makes legally owning a firearm more difficult and expensive.  \n\nAnother area of unreasonable gun regulations in California surround assault weapons.  Pretty much the entire concept and definition of what an assault weapon is rediculous.  Following San Bernardino the definition of what an assault rifle was changed (even though the terrorists had modified their weapons, which would have made them illegal anyway) and the public was given 6 months to register firearms that fit the new definition.  The change in the law was spread through word of mouth and the website to handle the registration wasn't able to handle the load.  Estimates I read indicate about 1\/2 to 1 million gun owners in California are now commiting a felony for failure to comply with the rule change.   \n\nAnother beauty of a law is this roaster of approved handguns.  Only certain models are allowed to be sold or imported into the state and few guns are added to the list each year.

{"author":"ElGrandeRojo2018","body":"Thanks. Glad to read this. \n\nMy opinion here is that the religious obsession in USA is also tied in with the geography though. I also think---, and I know it sounds really wrong from the liberal point of view-- but I sometimes feel that educated liberals are actually a bit too hard on these rural populations. Like, they don't seem to understand that, someone from smal town Wyoming of 300 people, simply never had the chance to live or maybe ever see international NY. It's thus very easy to understand why the person from Wyoming would still be interested in religion \"even in 2018\". In a very real way, it's almost still the past in a rural area. Even with the Internet. \n\nAfter all, what is there to do in a very small town? Not only are there no mighty universities but there's also no real entertainment either. So it's easy to imagine that someone in a rural place would get out of the partying lifestyle far sooner than someone from NYC, where you can party every night in some new rich nightclub, even if you're sorta poor. I think that people with not much to do except be sorta alone underneath some huge sky where you can see all the stars are much more likely to be religious. It's a lonely life with few distractions.\n\nI always say I first started to understand politics because I was an enormous music fan, and I was very obsessed, when Iwas young, with listening to every single genre. I always say I like the politics of the city but the music is a little too fast for me. Country living is contemplative...and in other respects, it's also easier, which is yet another reason I think they dig God more. I understand poverty in rural areas is very severe but there's also that beautiful side of rural living many will gladly tell you about, where they get to go fishing and swimming in lakes and maybe even hunt some animals from time to time. Plus maybe you grow tomatoes in your big backyard, and you make your own wine , your own liquor, etc. It's easy to see why people doing all of that would find the idea of needing government help preposterous. As hank Williams Jr. says \"you can't starve us out and you can't make us run\".\n\nThe issue is, sadly, the people trapped in the cities can be starved out, and that's why they are trying to say they need help and are liberals.

Next to nobody I ever talked to seemed open to EVER believing that there was some really bad shit going on in the USA. The only ppl back then all seemed like really whacky punk rockers who were highly aware. Otherwise, ripping on the USA was essentially verboten. Like, there was a wave of distaste for Bush, but bush also lived in the immediate post 911 years.\n\n It honestly was pretty much unheard of for normal Americans to talk too dirty of anything USA related then. Racism, prisons, drug war, expensive schools. All of it was not something you discussed. The USA was the bees knees. \n\nNow in the post trump years, ripping on the Usas numerous shitty policies (no healthcare, private prisons, no college etc) is literally in vogue. Literally everybody is talking about it. It's a conversation you can have no matter where you go, it seems. The ideas that I used to associate years and years ago only with the punks and the misfits are now ideas it seems totally normal people are having, and want enacted tomorrow.\n\nIn my opinion, the Trump supporters are a bunch of morons because they've basically exposed themselves, and now it's become something easy to point out and no one can deny it. Now that it's been exposed I believe it can be changed. The story of Ocasio-Cortez seems to be an exact example of this .

{"author":"SwampShillin","body":"Well, it depends on how we define the terms of course but decreasing taxes on businesses (and potentially income across the board), along with burdensome regulations that either stifle innovation or lead to crony-capitalism, like unnecessary licensing laws, while also increasing other revenue through things like capital gains taxes, potentially exploring VAT taxes, etc. and expanding things like healthcare coverage and other labor protections. That's a model that frees up businesses to innovate and grow the economy while simultaneously providing a safety net through things like Medicare for all and either a UBI or negative income tax.\n\nThe rise of populism (or whatever you want to call the anti-elite backlash we're seeing in western\/advanced economies) all over the world is party a result of globalization and trade agreements which has brought many people out of poverty but the west has seen a stagnation in standard of living over the past ~25 years and in many areas (especially manufacturing-heavy areas) an outright decline. These sectors of workers are shouldering the burden of the market adjustment that's happening. We need to find a way to allow the market to work, while also softening it's blow to certain sectors of workers. It's not going to be easy because of course we don't want to just give these people money to stay in dying towns and not find meaningful employment but simply saying...'well, you have to compete with these third world countries that don't provide the same standards of worker protections... so now you're out of a job... tough luck'... is not good enough.  \n\nThis will also mean finding a balance between letting in migrant workers or high-skilled workers on visas and making sure that these migrant workers aren't displacing American workers or simply being brought in to do jobs that Americans could do but for lower wages.\n\nSo, in short, I don't want your business to be taxed more... you need that money to innovate, invest in productivity-increasing measures, invest in labor, etc.... but I do think there's a way to allow you to do all of that *and* to broaden the tax base\/increase taxes in certain instances and pay for a larger safety net.\n\nI don't have all the answers of course but there are a number of people thinking about what this kind of capitalism 2.0 could look like.

{"author":"SwampShillin","body":"I watched all of the Bernie section in that video and agree with most of his larger points... I would quibble with some of the details of his arguments though. But yeah, I think that there is a way to simultaneously free up capital and economic dynamism *and* provide a large social safety net and potentially increase government involvement in certain sectors, while limiting its involvement in others. It's not an all or nothing dichotomy.\n\nEDIT: one of the points that Steven makes is that the US has a much higher corporate tax rate than Scandinavian countries... which isn't necessarily true. You should be a bit suspicious whenever someone only quotes the nominal rate instead of the effective rate. Our effective rate is around 18 - 20 % because our tax code is so complex. I think that this usually has the result of benefitting the larger companies that can afford to higher large accounting\/legal\/lobby teams to make sure that they're getting the best deal possible and smaller business often end up shouldering an undue burden of the high nominal rate. This should definitely change. Crowder compared the nominal US rate to the nominal Danish rate. I couldn't find stats on the effective Danish rate but I'm guessing it's much closer to their nominal rate because they tend to have a much more streamlined tax code - which of course is also better for business because people don't have to spend ridiculous amounts of time and money trying to comply with tax law. Here's another good article that compares some of our tax policy to scandinavian countries: [https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/how-scandinavian-countries-pay-their-government-spending\/](https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/how-scandinavian-countries-pay-their-government-spending\/)","created_utc":1532612063,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Furthermore, it can serve as a penalty to other countries with which we face unfair trade policies. For example (figures may be incorrect, this is just an example), Germany taxes our auto exports at 4%, we tax theirs at 2%. German cars are going to be pretty cheap compared to American cars therefore a lot more people are going to buy them. The threat of increased tariffs can be used as leverage to \u201cincentivize\u201d Germany lower their tariffs on US goods. Germany would be likely to comply because a US tariff on German cars would wipe out a large percentage of their exports. This turns into a \u201ctrade war\u201d if they decide to retaliate with tariffs, and then we retaliate with more tariffs, so on and so forth.

{"author":"proletariat_hero","body":"Any approach that seeks to strengthen private insurance\u2019s foothold in the healthcare system is not a step toward single payer. The problem is that the subsidies are given to insurance companies. Even if the subsidies were increased, and the insurance companies were legally forced to pay out more benefits, it would still be maintaining our market-based healthcare system - thus, none of those moves are getting us any closer to single payer. Single payer is when healthcare is paid for directly through tax dollars, eliminating the health insurance middlemen (parasites, in my opinion). As long as healthcare is treated as a commodity to create profit for middlemen accountants, rather than as a public service that is paid for directly through tax dollars (and in which care decisions are made between patients and their doctors, without the interference of insurance companies), then that is a private, for-profit system that is antithetical to any conception of single payer. \n\nBasically, we can\u2019t have private insurance and single payer healthcare at the same time. We could have a public option, sure. But that would be yet another example of maintaining the for-profit system - it would simply create government-funded competition in the marketplace.\n\nHealthcare doesn\u2019t belong in the free market.

The word ignorance is derived from the word \"Ignore.\" What you're doing is ignoring the truth simply because you're too stubborn and *ignorant* to admit you're wrong. You're trying to push your delusional opinions with weak evidence, and ignoring stronger evidence because you don't want it to be true. I used to be pro-Hillary and very anti-trump. However, people like you have shown me that I was not on the logical side of the argument. The only reason I hated trump was because I was influenced by others around me, as well as the media. All I saw and heard was \"Trump is racist and sexist!\" and \"Orange man is bad because he is orange and judges people based on their skin color!\" Once I actually began developing an independent, logical mind, I began to realize that most leftists, especially those who hate Trump the most, are just emotional, brainless and ignorant. I started thinking that maybe the conservatives had some good points, because I was finally pulling myself away from the shithole media and brainwashed society that we have become. Here's a song lyric that I think suits this situation pretty well. \"Now angry mob mentality is no longer the exception, it's the rule.\" Everyone who is against trump says the same exact things, and refuses to even listen to anybody on the opposing side. If you aren't one of them, you're instantly a racist, sexist idiot who's opinions should be ignored, regardless of what they are or what arguments there are to support them. This toxic, hateful hive-mind is like an ant colony. No individual and really knows what they're doing, they just mindlessly follow along with what everyone else does. The difference is that ants can actually accomplish things when they work together. With you guys, it's just a way of feeling like you're helping. Once I was finally able to recognize the left's false sense of self-righteousness, their lack of logical reasoning and usage of factual information, their ignorance, and their irrational feeling of superiority, I decided that I didn't want to be a part of it anymore. Conservatives didn't draw me in at first, stupidity drove me away from the anti-trump section of society. You guys are destroying yourselves. The more people that learn to use logic and to think with their heads rather than to blindly follow the delusional opinions of others, the less support the left will have.

Back to the main question.  \n\nRight, I did say that.  My point is that yes, I could be friends with a trump supporter (or anybody that disagrees with me politically, for that matter) because if you push them completely out of your life, you won\u2019t have any chance to understand their position and eventually get them to change their mind.  To do that, you usually need to get friendly with a person.  Being confrontational never persuades people, much less completely cutting them out of your life.  \n\nLet\u2019s say I meet a rabid trump supporter, but he\u2019s actually pretty chill, other than that.  We talk about politics for a bit, agree to disagree, and hang out, as friends tend to do.  Once you get to know people like that for long enough, they tend to open up to you.  You find out why they think that way and believe certain things.  If you get to know them well enough, you can bridge the gap and begin to understand their position, and at the same time, they\u2019ll begin to understand yours.

Equality does not mean equal outcome. This is exactly what the nationalization of healthcare does. Not only does it create dependency, but it also deprives those with more money of the right to property. If they can afford something that would ultimately be of greater personal benefit, then it is their fundamental natural right to make that investment as they see fit. Nationalization of healthcare is no different if the insurance industry were to become conglomerated and effectively monopolize into one single corporation. The only difference is that one such institution just so happens to call itself \u201cgovernment\u201d, and we\u2019ve been conditioned to love our government from birth.\n\nThe institution of the welfare state is also bad for a nation\u2019s survival - particularly a country that is fundamentally imperial in how it is structured, such as the United States.

While by no means the only, it is a significant indicator of an empire in decline. America is already exhibiting a few other of those traits already (let\u2019s just say that Donald Trump, for instance, is not history\u2019s first Donald Trump), and the thought of expanding welfare is a cause of concern for not just me, but many other scholars of history.

I guess the old adage is true: the only thing we have ever learned from history is that we still haven\u2019t learned anything from history.\n\nAnother point to bring up: the constitution grants us the right to life. That is not the same thing as promising State subsidization of life itself. We are entitled to the opportunity to justly pursue and fairly access the means to live, and the ability to do so according to our decisions and upon our own terms. A state is morally obligated to justly make sure that a man is able to lead to a healthy and happy life. For instance, it must therefore be responsible for ensuring that people are given access to healthcare. People confuse that often to mean, \u201cthe state is responsible for ensuring that the people are all given free healthcare.\u201d Instead, and without coercion, the state should strive to incentivize insurance companies to provide low-cost, basic plans to those who can not afford the standard rates. In addition to that, it should offer companies certain tax cuts in exchange for the promise to offer employee benefits. Along with those who are physically incapable of working due to reasons beyond their control, seeing as government programs would represent the final possible method through which they would have access, welfare and free subsidized services should only be given to those who make below a certain yearly income and the unemployed. However, in the case of that last one, they must prove that they are actively seeking employment. This will incentivize them to seek a job and prove themselves a productive member of society. However, market solutions should always come first, and any social welfare programs must be kept as the be all end all solution. \n\nJust because the state has control in the manipulation of the system in some way of another, it doesn\u2019t subtract from the sum of a nation\u2019s individual freedom. A man who lives under a state that regulates what he buys, what he may sell, what he can create, how he can use his money, who he interacts with, and what he decides to do with his own labor is not a free man, as he is a part of a free society that respects individual sovereignty. Yet, on the opposite extreme, absolute negative liberties can be problematic in their own way. A man who is impoverished, unable to afford basic necessities, vulnerable to people who may seek to exploit him, has no access to proper medical care, is unable to receive a basic education, does not make a living wage, and lacks any social equal opportunity, therefore deprived of his right to pursue his own happiness, is NOT a free man; just as the one who\u2019s actions are determined by the state, so too is he who is neglected by the state forever bound to serfdom.\n\nThis is why we need a small, but pragmatically sized government that exists primarily to protect our civil liberties\/natural rights, to build roads, to maintain national defense,  to preserve and further expand America\u2019s hegemonic supremacy (for the sake of peace, meaning such can not involve unnecessary foreign intervention or unprovoked military action), to uphold the rule of law, and to provide a basic social safety net for those who truly have no other option, therefore acting as a last line of defense for those who lack the opportunity of most people.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no reason for a government to be any larger than it has to be. Plus it would be logical to assume that people would be happier off to self determine instead of having limited control over their own pursuits...pursuits that would otherwise have made them happier people (so long as such actions were not committed at the expense of others). Further expansion of the state to a level that exceeds the essential level of operation is needless, wasteful, and irresponsible. Even at its functional level, it is an entity that people should be skeptical of on basic principle. Anarchy is not pragmatic, yet there is one particular order that surpasses such in its lack of pragmatism: that of the Prodigal State.\n\n","created_utc":1533051480,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"glittergluecoffee","body":"I disagree. Though I understand where your coming from. I predict the younger generation will grow up significantly less confused about morality.  Seeing all this corruption come to light is going to be a big deal.  the Trump administration will go down as one of the most corrupt in US history and will become a cautionary tale.  No matter how much \"winning\" you do, the truth will catch up.  Kids will grow up saying, \"Ugh, I don't wanna be like that Trump asshole... I'd better be honest\"  \n\nFor instance, I was a teenager when Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about a blow job.  My parents talked to me about it like I was an adult.  They pointed out to me that we all mess up.  Just don't lie about it. Lying will make it worse. Come clean and say \"yup. I messed up and I will try to do better in the future\" and then, actually do better.  Cuz Bill didn't get in trouble for the blow job.  Consentual blow jobs aren't illegal. Perjury is.  So, I've never wanted to make the same mistake as Bill, as a result, I'm generally more honest, so are my siblings.\n\nI've seen alot of parents use this administration  as a teaching tool about why the truth matters, how to verify claims by news media and elected officials, and why you should look at the world more objectively.  Alot of folks are taking their kids to protests and to vote.  I've brought my kids to several protests and they come with me every time I vote.  I explain to them why were protesting and why it's important to vote.  Other parents are doing the same.","created_utc":1533069415,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"letsgoantiquing","body":"I'm just saying that you can tell your kids, \"don't do _____\" over and over and over again - but if those kids SEE someone doing ______ and not getting into trouble for it, then the spoken message may not resonate as much as the seen one. Because they just saw an adult they're supposed to admire get away with doing something bad. You can tell your kid, \"don't be cruel to others!\" But if they SEE an adult being cruel and not being punished for it, they're going to be receiving a competing and contradictory series of messages and the wrong one may prevail. Unless a kid is modeled ethical behavior, there's no guarantee that just TELLING that kid, \"behave responsibly\" will result in that kid growing up to be a responsible adult. Right now the most powerful and admired man in the US is modeling unethical behavior for our young people. ","created_utc":1533069873,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}
