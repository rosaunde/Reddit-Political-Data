{"author":"SirJohnnyS","body":"I think we can. On the other hand, I can\u2019t demonize them. Being outgunned and without any knowledge of who it is, what they\u2019re armed with, if there could be more than one. \n\nI want to believe I would\u2019ve gone in but in reality it\u2019s a lot to ask of someone who may or may not have sufficient training in how to handle it. \n\nObviously go towards the gunfire but what if it stops, do you clear room by room, can you be sure it\u2019s over? Can you be sure who did it? Do you check every kid, clear every room? \n\nLearning from this incident, is training for this scenario adequate? Should we be better preparing school officers for this scenario? In the event there\u2019s hostages or multiple shooters, \n\nI\u2019m not sure about other schools but if this happened at the high school I went to, the hallways would be a nightmare. People running, the noise, it\u2019d offer little to no cover. The ricochet that the walls would create, getting a clear shot at the shooter would\u2019ve been a very tall order. \n\nBecoming a police officer though, you know it comes with the territory. It\u2019s your responsibility to protect others and you may be asked to risk you\u2019re safety and life one day, if you\u2019re not prepared to do that, don\u2019t join. \n\nI don\u2019t believe how Trump called him a coward was appropriate. He made a rational and logical decision to not run in there. \n\nI just think it deepens the argument that regulations on guns need to be stricter. When one police officer can be so outgunned and disadvantaged that odds of succeeding in neutralizing the threat are much lower than failing and dying, we need to re-evaluate that thought.

{"author":"SirJohnnyS","body":"There\u2019s some serious questions about universal healthcare too. \n\nWhat\u2019s the best most efficient way to transition to it? Can you really increase taxes that much and then tell people they have to go through the government for their healthcare now? \n\nHow do you prepare doctors for the stress that an influx of new patients will create? How do you prepare for the administrative side of it? \n\nHow do you implement it? A centrally run department? The Canadian version where a minimum of coverage is given to each territory to provide a minimum level and if the territory wishes to cover more they can decide to tax more. Do you allow supplemental coverage? What can you allow for supplemental to cover? How do you ensure continued R&amp;D by pharmaceutical companies to test and bring drugs to market unless there\u2019s an adequate profit made? That goes for most medical equipment. You can\u2019t force all those things to be enveloped by this? \n\nWhat\u2019s the political cost of doing this? 10 years of being the minority would be my guess. \n\nOffering the public option is the next step. Eventually that pool would be enough that it\u2019d offer the best coverage at the lowest expense. It would happen gradually too. It\u2019d allow for infrastructure to be established and flaws to be corrected. People instead would be paying for insurance not taxed. Drug companies would make sure the public plan can receive their pharmaceuticals because they would represent the largest number of people. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t flip a switch over night. \n\nThink tanks may not embracing the proposals that are out there because there\u2019s serious flaws with them and raise a lot of concerns and a lot of them are not capable of being carried out in their current form. \n\nAlso, the unintended consequences. How does that impact the financial sector? Healthcare and pharmaceuticals make up a lot of portfolios, not just traders but 401k\u2019s, mutual funds, etc. how do you ensure that people don\u2019t lose a significant part their retirement savings or investments because of the change in healthcare coverage?\n\nI don\u2019t really agree with that as the main reasoning liberal think tanks are not embracing the universal healthcare proposals currently is because the think tanks are funded by those companies. Maybe it\u2019s part of it but there\u2019s so much that factors in that their funding sources aren\u2019t driving what they\u2019re saying.

But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family. \n\nWe Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by *several* professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible.\n\nI don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms. \n\nThe religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you.\n\nYou see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you.\n\nIt's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.\n\nAll of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal.

A conservative congress filibustered every single judicial nominee and blocked the appointment of 50 other executive branch nominees. A conservative congress refused to even speak to the President's Supreme Court nominee. \n**Those things never, ever happened before in America.** They were a deliberate refusal to carry on the business of the Republic, because it was headed by a Democrat. Or a black man, take your pick: Conservatives are either fanatical extremists who don't see anyone else as having legitimacy in America, or they're bigots. Or possibly both.\n\nAll of these are facts. Whine all you like, but there is no equivalency at all between the two parties. None.","created_utc":1519979181,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"greaper007","body":"&gt;How feasible do you think that is in the age of long range missile and supersonic jets? How long do you think society will last when our power plants are destroyed? How do you resist a nation without a standing military?&lt;\n\nWell I never suggested eliminating all military expenditures, it's is interesting that in arguments about guns, military or police  levels the conservative response seems to be \"death!\" \"petulance\" \"enslavement\"\n\nMy point was that society can be protected with a smaller military focused less on expeditionary power and more on defense.  \n\n&gt;We were protected by oceans before WW2. They won't protect us today.&lt;\n\nSo that whole Pearl Harbor thing...\n\n&gt;And also, the US paid a horrible price in WW2 because of how unprepared we were. We lost a lot of people to accidents and being untrained. Had the British and Soviets not borne the brunt of the bloodshed, we would have.&lt;\n\nHad we done our job and joined the League Of Nations, prevented German war reparations, hooked Japan up with resources in the 20s and then just kept an eye on Germany in 30s and stopped their military buildup, we never would have gone to war.    \n\nThe USSR and UK bore the brunt of casualties because they're the closest.   I'm sure that in a war with Canada or Mexico our NATO allies would come to our aid, but I wouldn't expect UK personnel to have higher casualty rates than Americans.\n\n&gt;Nations today can't just wait to build up anymore. Technology is too complex and advanced to wait and loss of lives on both sides too great to afford it. How Jessica Alba military do you think you will have if I paid as little as a Chinese do and then tried giving it up? How many civilian lives do you think we will be going to lose because we weren't wanting to spend the money to for fill out basic defensive needs?&lt;\n\nI'm unfamiliar with your Jessica Alba reference.  The point I made about WWII wasn't that we should maintain a military level equivalent to that of 1939, it's that even in the worst situation we can still triumph.    Thus it's not crazy to wonder if a defense budget of $600 billion dollars is a little excessive.    And frankly, if maintaining a large military is itself a provocation for war?    Look at the post WWII landscape.    Rampant military spending and rampant wars of choice.   Vietnam, Ho Chi Mhnh actually modeled his declaration of independence after the US's.    That was a war for the rubber companies and defense contractors.    Iraq, where were the WMDs?   We all knew they never existed.   Afghanistan, I'll get into that later.\n\nIs our military really about \"defensive needs?\"    At $600 billion and multiple overseas locations I don't think you can claim defense anymore.\n\n&gt; don't think you understand basic history or differences in cost of living and what China and Russia has militarily today. You're caught up on nominal spending without looking at what a reduction in our capabilities means go to ourselves and to the world especially the liberal Western world&lt;\n\nHa Ha Ha, I actually have a BA in History with a 20th century focus.    I don't think that you understand that history isn't a monolith with a single agreed upon set of facts/opinions.    Buckley is going to have a different argument than Zinn (check out WWII: A People's War? from A People's History).    You have a right wing conservative, I'm guessing active duty Marine or Navy pilot (my dad was an F-14 pilot, hard to hide those stripes...:)) Whereas I'm coming from a left wing epistemology.    I haven't insulted your intelligence, yet you seem to think ad hominem arguments are fine, why?   \n\nThis is also the point in the argument where I reference Eisenhower's final speech on the military industrial complex.    It's relevant because he was right, It exists as a gigantic hungry monster that needs to be fed.    That I feel, is the primary reason for our massive military spending, not defense.\n\nAs much damage has been done to liberal democracy by US foreign policy as has been done by other super powers.    We lost our moral high ground somewhere around the Spanish American War, or maybe the Native American genocide, slavery....Again, the primary reason for that was the fact that we've maintained a large expeditionary force, and by golly why not use it?    Rome faced much of the same problem, you can't exist as a society in a constant state of war.\n\n&gt;You seem to conflate our size and our still being in Afghanistan as a failure. We are trying to build a nation too be self reliant. Did you know we only have 10,000 there today? The bulk of the fighting is done by the Afghanis who we are trying to support so they don't fail like the Iraqis did after we left.&lt;\n\nSo in 1960 were we still fighting Nazis in the Black Forest during the annual fighting season?    Afghanistan was unwinable, I knew that as a 21 year old college student.    My Vietnam history professor missed a day of class when he had to fly to washington to brief the government on the results of Vietnam.    He told us at the time \"well you can't really directly compare the two..\" but his eyes said otherwise. \n\nAfghanistan and Iraq were unwinnable wars that we entered to bolster the pockets of Cheney and his cronies.

{"author":"willbo2013","body":"I'll answer these one by one even though I don't have to:\n\n1. When it comes to my loved ones, I have higher expectations for their behavior because I know what they are capable of and hold them accountable accordingly.  My love for country is no different. \n\n2. Any student with half a brain knows that professors (just like average humans) have their own biases; if a student chooses to believe something different than the religion they were indoctrinated into, then that is their choice. \n\n3. There exists a social contract: the citizens pay taxes and the government protects those citizens.  It's ok to debate what those protections should look like (social security, medicare, medicaid) but classifying those with whom you disagree as communists does nothing to solve things like hunger and poverty. \n\n4. I believe in the first amendment; just as the government should remain secular (freedom from) the citizens should maintain the right to believe whatever they want to believe (freedom of) as long as those beliefs don't bring harm to others.  I don't give a fuck if you pray to crystals, but if you start trying to outlaw same sex marriage because your crystals told you to, then we'll have a problem. \n\n5. All celebrities have the right to voice their opinion (as long as it isn't hate speech or threats) and many choose to use their platform to do so.  As much as Ted Nugent has a right to say that Jesus loves his guns, Sarah Silverman has just as much a right to say that he's batshit crazy.  I identify with certain celebrities' opinions just as you probably do.  I take it as a form of expression rather than a form of \"teaching\". \n\n6. I don't hate anyone just because they aren't like me; I only hate those you want to bring violence, opression, disease, poverty, etc upon others.  On the other side, I don't love anyone just because they attend church every Sunday.  Show me with your actions, not your words, that you are a good person.  Then we can talk. \n\n7. See answer 1.  It's ok to expect more from the things you love most.  Our country is not infallible, and expecting those who don't see it that way to emigrate is asinine. \n\n8. I don't care if the president him/herself personally succeeds or not, I only care that he/she helps the country succeed/prosper.\n\n9. They shouldn't.  Freedom of expression.  Just as others have the freedom to not like your hat and tell you they don't like it (as long as it isn't hate speech or threats). \n\n10. It's only self-sabotage if you see it that way. If you do, then maybe re-examine your political ideologies. \n\n11. I could ask the reverse.  But to answer your question, there are some things that we should not compromise on (slavery, healthcare, civil rights, gender equality, etc.) so don't be upset when we dig in our heels to make sure the less-fortunate aren't shat on by repubs. \n\n12. We are all dependent on the government to some extent, and I don't mind sacrificing some personal freedoms (I can't own a rocket launcher or a sweat shop) if it means society functions more safely as a whole.  The answer to your question is more complex than a mere yes or no. \n\n13. No.  Nor should we penalize shitty life circumstances and reward inherited success. \n\n","created_utc":1520282735,"score":7,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Anurse1701","body":"Because all evidence shows that this country has been enriched by immigration. I'd say the argument for taking unskilled people, aka the huddled masses, rests on a few reasons. \n\nFirst, more people mean more consumers. More consumers, the more demand for pizza, beer, cars, and housing there is. More demand means more jobs and business growth to serve that demand.\n\nSecond, I have yet to see where this narrative about immigrants being welfare dependant is substantiated beyond levels that US citizens would consume over a lifetime. Immigrants have been demonstrated over and over again to improve economic growth.\n\nThird, wages have been depressed by globalization and the relentless assault on unions. Making immigration hard keeps people illegal, and allows the practice of under the table payments to continue to be done. The fact that the American worker has to compete globally and has zero bargaining power means they can't get ahead.\n\nBut the reason immigration doesn't get fixed is because businesses love illegal immigrants. They have little status under the law, do work at an incredibly low cost, and are still consumers. If you really want immigration to stop and illegal immigrants out of the country, you should pressure businesses, not the government.\n\nhttp://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2016/1/27/the-effects-of-immigration-on-the-united-states-economy\n\nhttps://cis.org/Testimony/Fiscal-and-Economic-Impact-Immigration-United-States","created_utc":1520338890,"score":7,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The issue is that those that want to ban guns like yourself or put heavy restrictions on them don\u2019t get that the second amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or personal defense. It has everything to do with militia use. A hunting or handgun would have very limited use these days in a militia, while the ones you\u2019re talking about banning first are the exact models you\u2019d want to have in that use case. \n\nThe whole \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\u201d part is quite specific and actually does make unconstitutional a lot of the restrictions we even have today. \n\nPerforming studies to support a stance when it\u2019s unconstitutional to perform said action seems like a waste of funds to me. There aren\u2019t a lack of anti-gun studies out there, and nobody\u2019s crazy to think that guns are dangerous. People get that, they aren\u2019t all as stupid as you might want to think, but people disagree on the cost:benefit associated with the second amendment.\n\nThat\u2019s an fantastic disagreement to have, and I think we should have a real public discussion on the exact topic.  Instead of focusing on the emotion of a tragic event that really does present a lopsided argument, we need to discuss the true costs of doing away with gun rights. Because you really would have to work a campaign to repeal the second amendment before you can legally push much further restrictions. \n\nFrom a perspective of today, removing the second amendment really removes a huge hurdle to a dictatorship / authoritarianism in the US. People somehow think that this can not be a thing, and I don\u2019t get what they think can stop it.  A piece of paper has no meaning without power to back it up. I think the current administration and its public support is proof that \u201cacceptable\u201d behavior in government is shockingly far more flexible than previously thought, when it accommodates a party staying In power.  It begs the question: How far could this go? With a large majority of the military are members of said party as well and under command of a president that doesn\u2019t subscribe to constitutional boundaries of power, my instinct tells me that it can go much further. \n\nWithout the second amendment or restricted to only handguns and hunting rifles aren\u2019t we just saying that we are ripe for exploitation or subjugation?

{"author":"frinkahedron","body":"Ego and pride can trick a person into believing that their own personal political views are special and more important than everybody else's, and it's their job to enlighten the world. Our culture of celebrity worship predisposes these folks into believing that everything about them is special.\n\nFor me, I don't really like hearing anybody rant about their personal political beliefs unless they have done their research on multiple angles of an issue AND they practice what they preach.  When I think of people I personally know, the ones who have done both of those things on various issues tend to *not* preach. They just quietly do what they think should be done to make the world a better place. Conversely, the people I know who do the most preaching/activism/whatever you might call it tend to have done less of both. It feels to me like celebrities usually fall into this camp. Case in point, Jenny McCarthy leading the crusade against vaccinating children. I don't know if I'm more disappointed in her for believing she was qualified to speak against medical professionals on this or in society in general for listening to her.\n\nAnyhow, I also agree with other points raised here about the way celebs (and I think us liberals in general) tend to beat people over the head with morality sticks.... framing issues in a way that \"you either agree with me or you're a bad person.\" This kind of posturing can make the person speaking feel righteous and good about themself, but it is not very persuasive to people not already 100% in agreement. IMO this was one of the problems of Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nYou are definitely not the only person who gets annoyed hearing celebrities telling the rest of the world how we should live.  /end rant.","created_utc":1520342619,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"The_Poop","body":"I don't think anything you said here is remotely true...\nIt may have been true in and around the 90s, but it's taken what has seemed to me a sharp turn for the better tbh.\nMaybe I'm just not listening to the \"correct\" conservatives and liberals, but what I have been seeing from the right these days is little to no mention of god or personal faith save for when following a disclaimer that it is *their* opinion/belief, and a heavy reliance on statistics and the rights outlined in the constitution. I don't necessarily agree with many of their positions, but the manner in which they present them and the rational foundations of those positions seems perfectly acceptable to me.\nMost importantly, I have seen an ever-increasing willingness to discuss their ideas with the opposition/ debate, and remarkably few instances of speech suppression or deplatforming . Maybe it's just confidence in their own ideas, and maybe it's for something to do with the younger conservatives and their values slowly replacing the older generation.\n\nAt this time I have very few practical complaints against the American conservatives, which relative to my perspective regarding them in the past is quite a leap forward.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems an equal and opposite phenomenon is occurring on the left...\nProgressives seem to rely heavily on faith-based arguments when it comes to issues pertaining to 'social justice' , and it appears to be a rather rare occurrence when a lefty even agrees to debate or even associate whatsoever with a righty.\nCensorship is rampant, and it seems that an ideological opponent must therefor be a bad *person* , according to many on the left.\nBias is swept under the rug, as if the \"liberal\" perspective is the *objective* one. I'll use a mainstream comparison for example: CNN and FOX are just about even in their biases. Both are unreliable sources of information as a result.\nBut unlike CNN, Fox is forthcoming with their bias. CNN prefers to pretend they have none. \nThis seems to be true in general of liberals. It's not enough to consider their *values* superiors to those of conservatives, they also insist that their *opinions* are *objectively true* , and as such do not require as much evidence if any--in many cases it would seem that they expect their positions to speak for themselves, and those who disagree are simply bigots.\nIt's clear to me that there are quite a few intellectuals on both sides, all with well-founded, interesting and reasonable points. But again, I've had a difficult time locating *progressive* intellectuals whereas there is somewhat of a surplus on the other end, or more specifically what I could consider the libertarian area or center/moderate. \nThat said, I'd be happy to discover some progressive intellectuals or effective representatives of anyone knows of any.\n\nPart of my point is exemplified by the post I am commenting on.\nI do not believe Donald Trump is a *racist* .\nI have not found ample evidence to come to that conclusion definitively. In fact, I am nowhere near arriving at that conclusion. \nThe fact that the notion of Trump being this racist, sexist, homophobic misogynist who hates trans people, Mexicans and Muslims (none of which are races) , seems to me an opinion based on hyperbole and misguided outrage. \nRather, he seems much more like he is simply a man in his 70s whose target audience is the average, working American. It isn't particularly effective for *me* , and admittedly I find a lot of the things he says to be extremely rash, unprofessional, crude and even ignorant at times. But nothing he has said indicates to me that he is a *racist* .\n\nAd hominem attacks such as this, which are typically quite slanderous (though one cannot technically slander the president of the United States in a legal sense) , are exactly what I'm talking about in regards to the gradual breaking down of the left.\nRacism is not an accusation most take lightly, and for good reason. It's overuse has dulled the word to the point of near-meaninglessness.  ","created_utc":1520584911,"score":-25,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"asilvermtzion","body":"OK, Punk isn't the focus of the article but it's what we seem to be picking up on here in the comments so I'll go with that... \n\nI think the author has a skewed and unrealistic view of what punk was and is about, how it's many forms differ, and how it evolved from it's initial juvenile rebelliousness. I think his analogy of Trump to that misconceived notion is spot on, but then it's just a diatribe on Trump, isn't it? It doesn't really have anything to do with punk. Other than the brief spark of nihilism that punk had at it's inception, before it became self-aware and socially motivated, the analogy doesn't stand and, quite frankly, is a bit insulting to punks.\n\nTo me, the article comes across as having a very conservative, US-centric, perception of punk. A view that someone outside of the scene would have if they never really explored it and took everything at face value. Studs and mohawks, spit and piss, violence and antisocial behavior. The mainstream media idea of punk. There's some very telling choice of words in there that reveal what the author considers to be hallmarks of the genre but in reality can only be attributed to a handful of performers and aren't indicative of the scene as a whole. Punks are just people, some of them are smart, some of them are dumb, some of them are nice, some of them are dicks, some of them are apathetic, some of them are highly motivated, some of them are ugly, some of them are beautiful...

{"author":"UnfortunatelyIAmMe","body":"**Part One**\n\n&gt; GLOUSTER, Ohio \u2014 At first, the experiment didn\u2019t have a name.\n\n&gt;Right after the election, Erik Hagerman decided he\u2019d take a break from reading about the hoopla of politics.\n\n&gt; Donald Trump\u2019s victory shook him. Badly. And so Mr. Hagerman developed his own eccentric experiment, one that was part silent protest, part coping mechanism, part extreme self-care plan.\n\n&gt; He swore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt was draconian and complete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to just steer away from Trump or shift the conversation. It was like I was a vampire and any photon of Trump would turn me to dust.\u201d\n\n&gt; It was just going to be for a few days. But he is now more than a year into knowing almost nothing about American politics. He has managed to become shockingly uninformed during one of the most eventful chapters in modern American history. He is as ignorant as a contemporary citizen could ever hope to be.\n\n&gt; James Comey. Russia. Robert Mueller. Las Vegas. The travel ban. \u201cAlternative facts.\u201d Pussy hats. Scaramucci. Parkland. Big nuclear buttons. Roy Moore.\n\n&gt; He knows none of it. To Mr. Hagerman, life is a spoiler.\n\n&gt; \u201cI just look at the weather,\u201d said Mr. Hagerman, 53, who lives alone on a pig farm in southeastern Ohio. \u201cBut it\u2019s only so diverting.\u201d\n\n&gt; He says he has gotten used to a feeling that he hasn\u2019t experienced in a long time. \u201cI am bored,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not bugging me.\u201d\n\n&gt; It takes meticulous planning to find boredom. Mr. Hagerman commits as hard as a method actor, and his self-imposed regimen \u2014 white-noise tapes at the coffee shop, awkward scolding of friends, a ban on social media \u2014 has reshaped much of his life.\n\n&gt; Extreme as it is, it\u2019s a path that likely holds some appeal for liberals these days \u2014 a D.I.Y. version of moving to Canada.\n\n&gt; Democrats, liberals and leftists have coped with this first year of the Trump presidency in lots of ways. Some subsist on the thin gruel of political cartoon shows and online impeachment petitions. Others dwell online in the thrilling place where conspiracy is indistinguishable from truth. Others have been inspired to action, making their first run for public office, taking local action or marching in their first protest rally.\n\n&gt; Mr. Hagerman has done the opposite of all of them.\n\n&gt; The fact that it\u2019s working for him \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m emotionally healthier than I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d he said \u2014 has made him question the very value of being fed each day by the media. Why do we bother tracking faraway political developments and distant campaign speeches? What good comes of it? Why do we read all these tweets anyway?\n\n&gt; \u201cI had been paying attention to the news for decades,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said. \u201cAnd I never did anything with it.\u201d\n\n&gt; At some point last year, he decided his experiment needed a name. He considered The Embargo, but it sounded too temporary. The Boycott? It came off a little whiny.\n\n&gt; Mr. Hagerman has created a fortress around himself. \u201cTiny little boats of information can be dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt; He decided that it would be called The Blockade.\n\n&gt; Behind the Blockade\n\n&gt; For a guy who has gone to great lengths to essentially plug his ears, Mr. Hagerman sure does talk a lot. He is witty and discursive, punctuating his stories with wild-eyed grins, exaggerated grimaces and more than the occasional lost thread.\n\n&gt; I recently spent two days visiting his farm on the condition that I not bring news from the outside world. As the sun set over his porch, turning the rolling hills pink then purple then blue, he held forth, jumping from English architecture to the local pigs\u2019 eating habits to his mother\u2019s favorite basketball team to the philosophy of Kant. He can go days without seeing another soul.\n\n&gt; This life is still fairly new. Just a few years ago, he was a corporate executive at Nike (senior director of global digital commerce was his official, unwieldy title) working with teams of engineers to streamline the online shopping experience. Before that, he had worked digital jobs at Walmart and Disney.\n\n&gt; \u201cI worked 12-, 14-hour days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe calendar completely booked.\u201d\n\n&gt; But three years ago, he decided he had saved enough money to move to a farm, make elliptical sculptures \u2014 and, eventually, opt out of the national conversation entirely.\n\n&gt; He lives alone and has never been married. As for money, a financial adviser in San Francisco manages his investments. Mr. Hagerman says he throws away the quarterly updates without reviewing them.\n\n&gt; Mr. Hagerman grew up in southeastern Ohio, and after years spent in Brooklyn warehouses, San Francisco tech bubbles and Nike-land in Portland, Ore., the idea of a quiet life became more and more appealing. His mother lives nearby; he sees her a lot since he moved back in 2015. She reluctantly adheres to The Blockade, although they do discuss the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n&gt; Mr. Hagerman begins every day with a 30-minute drive to Athens, the closest city of note, to get a cup of coffee \u2014 a triple-shot latte with whole milk. He goes early, before most customers have settled into the oversize chairs to scroll through their phones. To make sure he doesn\u2019t overhear idle chatter, he often listens to white noise through his headphones. (He used to listen to music, \u201cbut stray conversation can creep in between songs.\u201d)\n\n&gt; At Donkey Coffee, everyone knows his order, and they know about The Blockade. \u201cOur baristas know where he\u2019s at so they don\u2019t engage him on topics that would make him uncomfortable,\u201d said Angie Pyle, the coffee shop\u2019s co-owner.\n\n&gt; Mr. Hagerman has also trained his friends. A close friend from his Nike days, Parinaz Vahabzadeh, didn\u2019t think he was quite serious at first and, in the early days of The Blockade, kept dropping little hints about politics.\n\n&gt; The new administration compelled her to engage more deeply in politics, not less. She had only recently become a United States citizen, and she was passionate about the immigration debate. She did not let Mr. Hagerman opt out easily. \u201cI was needling him,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt; And in response, she received, for the first time, a stern text message. \u201cI\u2019m now officially cross with you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you know very well I don\u2019t wish to hear about current events.

{"author":"UnfortunatelyIAmMe","body":"**Part Two**\n\n&gt; They now speak on the phone several times a week, but never about the news. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually nice to not talk about politics.\u201d\n\n&gt; Conversations with Mr. Hagerman can have a Rip Van Winkle quality. He spoke several times about his sister, Bonnie, an assistant professor, who lives in, of all places, Charlottesville, Va.\n\n&gt; While he and I were talking, I looked over at him at every mention of Charlottesville to see if the name of the city, home to perhaps the ugliest weekend of the Trump era to date, made him flinch.\n\n&gt; \u201cSo, do you associate Charlottesville\u201d \u2014 I would say the name deliberately and with emphasis \u2014 \u201cwith anything besides your sister?\u201d\n\n&gt; He didn\u2019t bite. I think he really didn\u2019t know about the Nazis.\n\n&gt; Later, he pointed to a house on a hill and said that before the election, the neighbor had decorated his lawn with an effigy of Hillary Clinton behind bars. I wanted to point out that the recently unveiled Mueller indictment found that a Russian troll had paid for a Hillary impersonator at a Florida rally. But I bit my tongue \u2014 Mr. Hagerman didn\u2019t know about Mueller, or Russia, or trolls.\n\n&gt; Last winter, Mr. Hagerman spent several weeks visiting his twin brother, a tech C.E.O., in San Francisco. Strict arrangements had to be made \u2014 the Sunday newspaper kept out of sight, the TV switched off, his teenage niece and nephew under special instructions.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe bigger challenge was when we would have friends come over and visit,\u201d said his brother, Kris. \u201cWe had to have Erik not be there, or we would give them a heads up that Erik has this news blockade going and we gave them the guidelines.\n\n&gt; \u201cThey were always a little bemused by it. And to some extent a little envious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prospect of just chucking all that for a period of time felt somewhat appealing.\u201d\n\n&gt; To be fair, Mr. Hagerman has made a few concessions. He reads The New Yorker\u2019s art reviews, but is careful to flip past the illustrated covers, which often double as political commentary. He watches every Cavaliers game, but only on mute.\n\n&gt; He counts a few boats that have sailed past The Blockade. He saw a picture of Kim Jong-un on a newspaper at the coffee shop, signaling that something was up with North Korea. And he overheard someone saying something about Obamacare, which meant health care was back in the news. His brother alerted him to the Equifax breach for his own protection.\n\n&gt; \u201cBut the blockade has been pretty damn effective,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said.\n\n&gt; He said that with some pride, but he has the misgivings about disengaging from political life that you have, by now, surely been shouting at him as you read. \u201cThe first several months of this thing, I didn\u2019t feel all that great about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me a crappy citizen. It\u2019s the ostrich head-in-the-sand approach to political outcomes you disagree with.\u201d\n\n&gt; It seems obvious to say, but to avoid current affairs is in some ways a luxury that many people, like, for example, immigrants worried about deportation, cannot afford.\n\n&gt; \u201cHe has the privilege of constructing a world in which very little of what he doesn\u2019t have to deal with gets through,\u201d said his sister, Bonnie Hagerman. \u201cThat\u2019s a privilege. We all would like to construct our dream worlds. Erik is just more able to do it than others.\u201d\n\n&gt; What if, he began to think, he could address his privilege, and the idea of broader good, near to home?\n\n&gt; He has a master project, one that he thinks about obsessively, that he believes can serve as his contribution to American society.\n\n&gt; He calls it The Lake.\n\n&gt; At the Lake\n\n&gt; On a recent spookily warm day, Mr. Hagerman clambered up a steep bank of woods, pushing past vines and stepping past fallen logs.\n\n&gt; Wide-eyed, giddy with excitement, he led the way to a flat stretch of brush where he spread his arms and began talking even faster than usual. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ll build a giant barn. It will feel like a cathedral. The cloister will be here,\u201d he said, making reference to Chartres, and Oxford, and the grandeur of medieval cathedrals.\n\n&gt; About nine months ago, he bought some 45 acres of land on the site of a former strip mine. The property, untouched for decades, has been reclaimed by nature \u2014 deer, beavers, salamanders and canopies of majestic trees are thriving.\n\n&gt; We walked further to the edge of a steep drop-off. Below, a bright blue lake shimmered in the February heat like a secret. He\u2019ll debate as long as you want whether the body of water counts as a lake or a pond. It\u2019s easier if you just agree it\u2019s a lake.\n\n&gt; \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how great it feels to go swimming there,\u201d he said. He added, with almost rapturous glee, that the lake sits in the spot where the mining company dug deepest.\n\n&gt; Mr. Hagerman sees this land as his life\u2019s work. He plans to restore it, protect it, live on it and then preserve it for the public. \u201cI will never sell this land,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt; He wouldn\u2019t put it exactly this way, but he talks about the land in part as penance for the moral cost of his Blockade. He has come to believe that being a news consumer doesn\u2019t enhance society. He also believes that restoring a former coal mine and giving it to the future does.\n\n&gt; \u201cI see it as a contribution that has civic relevance that aligns with my passions and what I do well,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said. \u201cI\u2019m going to donate it. It\u2019s going to take most of my net worth. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my money on.\u201d\n\n&gt; He has filled an entire room of his house with a 3-D rendering of the property to better envision his plans. He has hired Gary Conley, a local landscape ecologist, to advise on the project. Mr. Conley, a gentle bearded outdoorsman who can speak at length about the preferences of the local amphibians, believes that the land could become something special.\n\n&gt; Mr. Conley indulges Mr. Hagerman\u2019s fantasies for the land \u2014 a walkway modeled on an ancient Mayan ballgame! Land art inspired by \u201cSpiral Jetty\u201d! Windows and concrete blocks, so many blocks! \u2014 but Mr. Conley mainly serves as the straight man to inject ecological reality into the plan.\n\n&gt; Mr. Conley respects The Blockade. After all, the project of The Lake might not exist without it.\n\n&gt; In those carefree pre-Trump days, Mr. Hagerman would settle into the coffee shop with his newspaper and dig in. But after The Blockade, he could only read the weather \u2014 \u201cFor elderly men it\u2019s endlessly interesting\u201d \u2014 and the real estate listings.\n\n&gt; It was during one of those long boring mornings, with no news to read, that he found the listing for The Lake.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first time I saw it, I said, \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n~~                                                                                                                 ~~\n\nSorry I'm two hours late.","created_utc":1520715039,"score":7,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"SirJohnnyS","body":"Glass-Steagal separated investment and commercial banks. When Clinton repealed it, commercial banks could pretty much gamble with their client\u2019s money. So they had nothing to lose. \n\nFast forward to the housing boom, it didn\u2019t matter who bought houses because the banks who lent the money would sell off the mortgage to another firm. So commercial banks didn\u2019t care who they lent money to because they\u2019d sell it ASAP anyways. Those loans would get bundled and sold as A bonds, indicating they were safe but there was no oversight to that rating. So a unemployed persons mortgage was still rated as a safe bond. \n\nDF tried to correct that lack of oversight. So far so good but I think the jury is still out. The recession is still lingering in people\u2019s heads so that may be part of it too. \n\nThere\u2019s a handful of changes likely to happen. The one I\u2019m bothered with the most is the $50b shift to $250b for the deeper scrutiny. It needs to be higher than 50, even Barney Frank said it should be higher. He thinks 125b is a better point to start digging in. 250b threshold allows about 24 banks and major lenders to avoid those stress tests and oversight. \n\nCurrently, banks with assets under $10b aren\u2019t subject to multiple stress tests a year from the Fed. So when they hit the 10b threshold, they\u2019re expanses jump quite a bit to handle that scrutiny. The Volcker rule which regulates the banks involvement in hedge funds and other riskier investment changes at $10b. \n\nWhat I would do is tweak the rules for community banks, opposed to rolling back the regulations as a whole. Or drastically changing them. \n\nMost DF is good. And the more I\u2019ve read the more i see the most important parts are sticking in. The credit risk section for example. They still have the higher capital reserve ratio in place.(one thing I think they could relax on smaller banks though). Among more. No one comprehended it when it was signed, it\u2019s still a lot to decode in the changes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a catalyst to the next recession though.

Despotic rulers stirring up xenophobia and starting wars to legitimize themselves is the oldest trick in the book.\n\nSo it is interesting and not really surprising that conservatives show more active limbic systems. I agree that it doesn't really say much about \"intelligence\" per se (which I would argue doesn't really exist as a single thing but that's another topic) but it supports the intuition that liberals tend to be more optimistic about humanity, historical progress, and human nature, while conservatives tend to be more pessimistic, distrusting of human nature, and anxious about change - feelings apparently driven by more overall fear, anxiety, and anger in their cognition (or the causation could be the other way around!)\n\nI would also add that many philosophers and intellectuals have made the argument (which I'm inclined agree with) that the dominance of liberalism and liberal views in the population, is an inevitable byproduct of industrialization and the increasing peace and prosperity of the modern era. It appears that desperation (poverty and violence) is a driving force of extremist and fundamentalist ideologies - and that once free of desperation, people calm down and become more tolerant and prosocial.

It was used as a law system more than an actual religion. I then became atheist for probably around 5 years. Around 22 was the first time I heard from the saying from nothing nothing can exist. That simple line that I heard on TV Made me realize that atheism made no sense. Something and I have no idea what that something is but something has always existed. now this parts going to make me sound like I\u2019m a nut job, but shortly after this was the first time that I used magic mushrooms. Within a matter of 30 minutes I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was something greater than the physical world that we see every day. That feeling of connectedness changed my way of thinking forever. I truly believe that if everyone were to have the experience that I had they would believe in something beyond the physical world. Ever since then I have been trying to figure out what exactly I do believe in. It seems to me That you were trying to take a scientific approach to explain something that currently science cannot. There are many things that science has no explanation for. Many things that were considered to be scientific fact 50 years ago have been disproven. Simply not having evidence for something does not mean it Doesn\u2019t exist. You seem like a scientific minded person, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s un imaginable That possibly within my lifetime a persons consciousness could be uploaded to a computer.

It never quite made sense to me how religion could be wrong because religion is based on god and god should never be wrong. On top of that, scientists made claims that went against what religion said. For a little bit, I believed a in a middle ground where god caused the big bang and helped evolution get carried out, but then I realized it probably made more sense for Christianity to just be false, so I became an atheist. At that point I didn't even know the word atheist existed. Also, keep in mind, I was a fifth grader when I figured this, so this is a more developed version of my thought process at the time. I obviously have spent a lot of time refining my thoughts. I filled in some of the gaps, but my point is that I'm not just blindly following science.

Remember, at the time of the French revolution guns were extremely expensive; the proletariat storming Versailles weren't exactly well armed with firearms.\n\nI completely disagree.\n\nPrior to the firearm, military power was heavily dependent on highly trained knights/cavalry who were expensive and had to be upper class. The loyalty of these extremely powerful individuals to noble lords put a great degree of power in the hands of nobility and out of the hands of the centralized king/state. The king depended on the feudal lords to maintain power and often had to negotiate with them lest they overthrow him.\n\nFirearms made the highly trained knights more and more irrelevant over time. Suddenly peasants could be just as useful as soldiers as highly trained and expensive knights. That was the defining moment that led to the centralization of power in the hands of the monarch and peasants against the lords and knights.\n\nThe printing press was heavily censored originally. It was only due to the arguments of nobility/wealthy bourgeoisie that freedom of the printing press was allowed in some regions. This was not universal and is still not universal to this day.\n\n&gt; The fact that nuclear weapons are so fearsome are why they aren't especially useful for suppressing the masses.

It should be part of the government to make sure everyone has the same access  to education. It's education that keeps getting dragged through the mud when there's plenty of great things happening at public schools but there's still under funding and under paid teachers. And the lower income districts depend on national funding when there isn't enough locally.

And education is constantly changing so it is often necessary to take classes in new standards, technology, curriculum, or just different pedagogy.\nYeah, NCLB was terrible and the first rolling out of Common Core was rough but I think there are a lot of good things from the standards.

{"author":"RoastedWithHoney","body":"As to our rights being afforded to us naturally, our founders(U.S.) said they are provided by God...I just like to use naturally instead of God because I've found saying God immediately changes the conversation. \n\n\nWhat that means, to my understanding, is that our foundational rights in the US are not the governments to give. They exist beyond government, the freedom of speech and religion, for example, being paramount rights of the individual which are protected(not granted) by our constitution.\n\n\nWhere this diverges from collectivism is when the collective starts demanding restrictions to the individual. The current broad stroke example is groups shutting down speech they do not like, like 'punching Nazi's' or De-platforming speakers on college campuses. The Liberal, from my perspective, defends the rights of people to speak whether they like what they are saying or not.\n\n","created_utc":1521551526,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Rights are a fiction we've made up to protect the kinds of things you outlined... and as far as I can tell, they're only as powerful or real as they are convincing. So if you were to travel to some place where no one believed in the same rights you did, could we really say that you still have those rights? I think it would be reasonable to try to convince them that your story is a good one and that they would be better off if they believed it but the power of the story seems to be limited by those in the collective.\n\nNone of that is to say that I don't think we should build our societies off of the idea of rights... but the biggest tension I see in common understandings of \"rights\" is the right to property.

It allowed for the middle class to flourish and the modern *man* to become a political element in our Democracies and Democratic Republics. So yes i believe in the right to property.\n\n\nWhat are the limitations to the rights to property? Owning people. This is the great shame of what made early America great and shameful. Property rights were at the center of the people who defended slavery's arguments and it is a gross extension of the term property.

I think that the state is both tasked with upholding those individual rights but also guarding against monopolies (of wealth and power), extreme poverty, etc... all of which effectively nullify the rights of the individual. So in short, it's a balance.\n\n&gt; How would you define collectivism in the context of this conversation?\n\nHere's the definition I found: \"the practice or principle of giving a group priority over each individual in it.\" I think people tend to bring there own interpretations to that and imagine more or less extreme versions of \"giving a group priority\". I would say that taxation is an example of this principle... but of course it's reciprocal... we tax people in order to fund a military that protects everyone. So in a well-balanced state, the group priority should support the individual.

A less radical version would nationalize healthcare instead (like the NHS in the UK) or a heavily regulated private industry where companies are forced to operate as not-for-profit institutions (like in Germany).\n\n* **Gun control**: Repeal of the 2nd Amendment. Complete ban on all guns involving some combination of buy backs and outright seizures.\n\n* **Taxation**: Going back to the tax systems of 1950s and 1960s in the US. Corporate taxes would be hiked to about 90%. Top tax brackets would start from 75%\n\n* **Trade**: Trade deals of the past would be replaced with treaties that would severely reduce imports and focus almost exclusively on American exports.\n\n* **Unemployment**: Introduction of policies like Federal Job Guarantee to make sure the entire populace contributes to the economy.\n\n* **Poverty**: Enactment of policies like Universal Minimum Income and Universal Newborn Bonds (or Baby Bonds).\n\nYou get my point.

"body":"What I want, is a discussion. On some policies I'm incredibly right leaning and some very left. I know a lot about the Republican argument and the way they think, but I don't know that much and liberals and, primarily, why they don't like trump. The reason I'm here, asking this question, is because I want to understand more about your perspective and see what kind of opinions you have, so I can more correctly make my own decision, while being a bit more educated than I was before. That's why I'm asking questions, and why I want an actual thought provoking discussion. \n\nAnd yes, I don't like him. I've said that several times, and I haven't defended the man at all. But, my point of view is to always respect the man in the Oval Office, because I'd rather believe that he is trying to do something good for his country, and I understand he's done some bad stuff, but just today he banned bump stocks which is something I have been advocating for, and I was happy about that. I have this view regardless of who the president is. \n\nSo, I'll pick two out of your list, and then give my opinion on it, and you can argue, agree, whatever floats yer boat. \n\nFor gun control, I've usually had some hard leaning right views, but in my mind the best thing we can do is ban things that are not actually useful for target shooting or hunting, and plain overkill for self defense, like bump stocks and 40 round mags. These have no purpose but to shoot faster and longer, which isn't needed for hunting/target shooting/personal defense. I think we should have a license, just like for a car, but you're not expected to register your weapons. But for your license you take an intensive class, repeating health checks and background checks even after you graduate, but the age to buy remains 18. Also private sales are illegal and if you are found to have a gun without a license you will face penalties, the gun won't be taken away but there will be hefty fines, and forced participation in the class to obtain the license. Gun shows just become like gun stores, need to have a license to buy. Would you rather see all weapons banned, just ARs, or have a different solution? I could concede to harsher government involvement depending on what way they're doing it. \n\nI think drug policy should be left to the states, and that if enough of the citizens want marijuana to be legal, then it should be legal in that state. But I also think it should stay illegal on a federal level, in terms that our soldiers or government workers/politicians can't use it. Anything other psychedelics aside from weed, I don't really care what happens there, probably should just be up to the state. Any other drugs should be illegal on state and federal level, other drugs as in crack heroine cocaine all that shit. But overall, I think trump should just give the power to the states, but keep it illegal for our government workers of any form. I think this is a pretty standard opinion that most people wouldn't really argue with but I'd love to hear your ideas on it. ","created_utc":1521850552,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I think that younger republicans have far less extremist views, and are way more open to the idea of homosexuality and supporting those in need. I've seen a lot more people such as Kyle Kyshuv and Ben Shapiro who aren't afraid to discuss certain topics and have actually been making a real impact. There are good republicans, I guess is what I'm saying. But I feel like calling all of them bad is just a generalization. Which in some situations makes sense.  \n\nAnd I think most republicans that voted for trump are going back on that decision, and I highly doubt you'll see him get reelected, because the voter turnout for the left will be huge now they know that republicans are willing to put any orange man in office to spite them.

"body":"Law student here. \n\nWhat you are doing is called statutory interpretation. You are reading the statute and attempting to derive some meaning from it. This is what lawyers do every day. and it is what lawyers have done about this very amendment in the Case D.C. V. Heller. There the Supreme Court, for the first time in American history, actually began looking into the text of the second amendment. Now, it should be noted, that this was in DC, so this was not the incorporation case, this was simply the interpretation case (I'll get to incorporation in a moment). So lets look at the statute for a moment: \n\n\n- *A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.*\n\nLet's be honest, no one knows what that means. If you can read that and derive some true meaning you are nuts. But there were two main arguments that arose. \n\n**First**, *'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State'* is a truism. It is a statement of intent. This would be like writing the first amendment:\n\n *'Knowing the value religion brings to a community, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the entire first half of the second amendment has no legal grit. After removing the first half you are left with, *'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'* The next major question, is what is an arm and what does it mean to keep/ bear it. Basically this is what the court decided. 1. An arm is any FIREARM, in common use (what is common use you may ask. I dunno, they didn't tell us). 2. To keep an arm means to own it. Which does allow for the purchase of arms. 3. And to bear arms means to have access. \n\nSo, to keep and bear arms translates to: **The right of the people to purchase and have access to firearms in common use shall not be infringed by the federal government**. Which, under that more clear reading would show why banning the sale of arms would not work.\n\n**Second** the other argument that was put forward was that the phrase, *'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State'* actually does have meaning. Under this reading, the second amendment does not protect AN INDIVIDUAL'S right to keep and bear arms, but THE PEOPLE'S right. Basically, this means that a STATE, can keep and bear arms in a well regulated militia established for the common defense. Well, this actually makes sense. Every state in the union has a militia. Every city does. In fact armed state militia members are a part of our every day life. We call them police. Under this reading, the second amendment would translate to\n\n*As police are necessary part of life, the right of a state to establish an armed and well regulated police force shall not be infringed. \n\n**What the court choose**: The choose the first. If you have ever heard of Scalia it was decisions like this that made him so hated. They make no sense, follow no existing precedent, and are just weird. Up until Heller no one really believed you had a 'right to bear arms.' That was Heller. But this decision was not the end of the world. You see, the Bill of Rights only applies against the federal government. So state governments were still allowed to ban guns.\n\nAnd no, the 14 amendment did not incorporate the Bill of Rights as is so often stated in bad high school history classes (Slaughter house was the case that FLAT OUT SAID, 'the 14 amendment does not incorporate the bill of rights'). However, it did provide people with DUE PROCESS. What is DUE PROCESS you may ask. I Dunno, they didn't tell us. And in the 140 years since the 14 amendment was passed, we have kinda used the Bill of Rights to guide what due process means. The logic basically being, 'well if you have a right to it, it must be part of the process that is due to you.'\n\nThis brings us to 'McDonald v. Chicago.' One of the strangest cases ever decided. Heller was the bad interpretation of the 2nd amendment, but Mcdonald was the one that said, THE SECOND AMENDMENT APPLIES AGAINST THE STATES. Further than that, the second amendment is a constitutional right, which means no state law can ever superseded it.  \n\nSo, the modern system is that there is basically a constitutional amendment that say, ' The right of the people to purchase and have access to firearms in common use shall not be infringed by ANY government.'\n\nSo moving forward, there are only two paths. One, wait for a right leaning member of the supreme court to die and be replaced by a Democrats who will do away with Heller and go back to option B. or two, pass a congressional amendment. Either way, it's not happening soon. \n\nedit: spelling, and there are probably more ","created_utc":1521937977,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

"body":"We can\u2019t have sane gun laws, as we used to have, because of the Second Amendment. This is an interesting argument, because the Second Amendment hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nWhat has changed is the lineup of conservative justices who read the Constitution, and their intention of finding in it everything they want to find, just as they used to accuse liberal justices of doing. The difference is that what the new justices are finding runs counter to common sense, common understanding and what the actual majority of voters actually wants. And as often as not, these new judicial fantasies also run counter to the vision of the founders who wrote the Constitution.\n\nNow, in addition to a historically recent and crazily absolutist reading of the Second Amendment (disallowing any operative meaning to the \u201cwell-organized militia\u201d part), the Supreme Court will take up gerrymandering again. So far justices have been inclined to pretend that consent of the governed and equal protection have no judicial weight in protecting, you know, the consent of the governed and equal protection. Their hands are tied, across their eyes, making it just too complicated for them to see the obvious.\n\nAnd underlying these distortions is yet a more fundamental one. Somehow the court, in its aggressive lack of wisdom, has been ruling that the sluice-gates of money pouring into the political process must be opened fully. We are now at the point where kids\u2019 math class is devoted to calculating exactly how much each of their lives is worth under this brave new campaign accounting system.

Their are infinite variations of conservatives in different societies.\n\nPlus this was a survey of about 200 college students. The testing techniques they used to develop their results was well thought out. Their given subjects came from one age group (most college folks are in their late teens and early twenties) from turkey so the degree of conclusion you can draw from this survey is weak.\n\nI wish they surveyed more age groups of all backgrounds in this country in higher numbers.

It wasn't about whether the stereotypes were negative or positive or whether those stereotypes were of any kind of a partisan nature. It was based on what is called a [lexical decision task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_decision_task). \n\nFor instance, just because liberals have well defined and accessible stereotypes about conservatives does not mean that liberal is reliant on those stereotypes when formulating a response to a conservative. In fact, as the study shows, stereotype suppression comes at a significant cost. Precisely because liberals are well aware of them and must expend psychological resources to actively suppress it.\n\n&gt;\u201cOur results also suggested that this stereotype suppression tendency can be costly on behalf of liberals; liberals with low (vs. high) stereotype accessibility performed worse in an independent self-regulation task, suggesting that they may have used up their [self-regulatory resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulation_theory) when suppressing stereotypical thoughts.\n\nLink added. So it has nothing to do with the absents of stereotypes, negative or otherwise. But merely a recognition that those stereotypes may be misleading and planning around those potential errors.

At my school, an A in an AP class is a 5.0, an A in an honors class is a 4.5, and an A in a standard or non academic class is a 4.0. The most competitive students who take the most advanced classes and get straight A's through high school end up usually around the 4.5 mark.

What has changed is the perception of demographics that has elevated their willingness to take the stage with it. Or at least tacitly support those that do. There was a time when racist, or just right wing ideology in general, wasn't openly admitted to even by those pushing it. But there is always a back reaction to every reaction. Whether that reaction is left wing, right wing, racist, or pro/anti whatever. But the death of any dominating ideology is always preceded by chaos generated by increasingly extreme pressure to push it further. The chaos generated by right wing extremist today was mirrored in the 1970s. Only then it was left wing terrorist organizations like the Weather Underground et al. Leading right up the Reagan's election. The next 40 years was then marked by a right wing shift in both the Democrats and Republicans, lead by the Republicans. Ideologically the Democrats became Third Way Democrats, which Bill Clinton was the progenitor of. Prior to 1980 both parties had been shifting to the left for decades, lead by the Democrats.\n\nSo what is behind the voting % is the product of (dis)enfranchisement built on a perception of the public at large.

"body":"Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to be supported. You can\u2019t expect the first amendment to make what you say true, or to protect your ability to make money on lies. Fox News lies constantly as an organization. It exists to be the propaganda arm of the right wing. Nothing in the first amendment means advertisers have to buy their commercials, or that I need to buy things from advertisers who buy their commercials. In fact, if you agree with the idea that money equals speech as the Supreme Court did in the Citizens United ruling, it would be free speech for me to not buy products advertised on Fox News, such making a statement with my money as to what I think should and should not be supported. So I, as a \u201cprogressive tolerant liberal\u201d agree that Free Speech is something that we shouldn\u2019t be afraid of. I think where we differ is that I am also not afraid of intelligent conversation and fact based learning.\nFurthermore if my response to this point has not been enough, I don\u2019t think any liberal, progressive or otherwise, wishes to shut down free speech. If you would like to say what you want you can, and do can I. Just don\u2019t expect private corporations to always host your or my thought (Reddit, YouTube, Verison, ect.) Since they own their own platforms, they can demonitzie, block, or ban anyone they want and it is in no way violating free speech.
