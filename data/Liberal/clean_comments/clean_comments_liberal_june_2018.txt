{"author":"RoleModelFailure","body":"&gt; Toxicology would later show Hill was intoxicated, to the point he could not legally drive.\n\nOk, but he was in his own garage listening to music.  Is it illegal to be drunk in your own home?\n\n&gt; Another factor prompting the attorney to seek a new trial is that the defense mentioned Hill was on probation for drug possession, which Phillips feels was meant to vilify Hill, as Newman had no way of knowing this when he responded. Hill's probation was also set to \"automatically terminate\" 11 days before his shooting, he said.\n\nHe was on probation for drug possession.  He was in his own home, in his own garage.  Even if owning a gun was breaking his probation it is not ok to kill him.  This news came after the shooting, his probation had no influence on the shooting itself.  What is the purpose of it in the trial other than to vilify somebody?\n\n&gt; The bullet from the first shot got stuck in the door, Phillips said. The second and third hit Hill in the abdomen, and the fourth struck Hill's head, he said. Lopez did not open fire.\n\n&gt;Not realizing Hill was dead, the deputies called for a SWAT team and snipers, according to the lawsuit. They kicked in doors and cut holes in the garage door, the suit claimed.\n\n&gt;\"Deputies shot tear gas canisters into the Hill home through many windows while severely damaging the windows and interior of the home and leaving toxic tear gas residue in the home,\" the lawsuit said.\n\n&gt;Once inside, officers found Hill dead with an unloaded handgun in his back pocket, not his hand, court records show.\n\nSo he had a gun on him and the call was for a noise complaint that escalated to an officer shooting 4 times through a door and then calling swat and tear gassing the house.  That seems a bit overkill for a guy who had an unloaded gun in his pocket.\n\n&gt; Despite the door being closed, Newman fired his handgun approximately four times and killed Hill.\"\n\nJust blindly shooting through closed doors without being able to see what is on the other side.  Smart.\n\n&gt; Because the jury found that Mascara was only 1% responsible, the verdict was reduced to 4 cents, and then, because the jury found that Hill was drunk at the time, the final payout was nothing.\n\nAh yes, being drunk in your own home is absolutely awful.  Shooting a gun through a closed door is perfectly fine.\n\n&gt; Mascara applauded the verdict, saying, \"Newman was placed in a very difficult situation and like so many fellow law enforcement officers must do every day, he made the best decision he could for the safety of his partner, himself and the public given the circumstances he faced.\"\n\nYes, officers must make difficult desicions everyday.\n\n&gt; \"After Newman knocked on the doors, the garage door opened revealing Hill within the comfort of his own garage and home,\" the lawsuit alleged. \"Upon information and belief, Deputy Lopez indicated loudly that Hill had a gun and then the garage door closed. Despite the door being closed, Newman fired his handgun approximately four times and killed Hill.\"\n\nLopez announced that Hill had a gun... but\n\n&gt; The bullet from the first shot got stuck in the door, Phillips said. The second and third hit Hill in the abdomen, and the fourth struck Hill's head, he said. Lopez did not open fire.\n\nHe did not open fire.

It doesn't get much more pathetic than that, but then again, these past couple years have proven we don't actually know how stupid or pathetic people can really get, because we haven't yet hit rock bottom.\n\nRecent shooters and hate crime perpetrators, though, have all or mostly been trump\/NRA supporters, and there's no denying there's been an increase in hate crimes and racism since trump's run for office.

All it would have taken to prevent the Santa Fe shooting was for the parents to lock up their weapons. It's that simple, and trump has done absolutely nothing to prevent further shootings.\n\nI've stated the facts, and facts do not exist to be debated, otherwise they wouldn't be facts.

He's not the problem, just an symptom, but a vote for him was failing as a human being and an American. One vote isn't going to change anything. Even a lot of people's one votes won't change anything. It's going to take a lot of voting a lot of times. All the old hippie tactics, too. The petitions and protests, patchouli and solidarity. Some of that social web stuff rigmarole, I'm sure.\n\nOne vote won't make a dent. Repeatedly dropping 5,500 miles of brick on someone's head will start to make an impression. That amount of work, that kind of thinking and resolve, takes a whole different kind of marketing than getting someone to cast one vote, though. In some ways it might be easier to present being a part of a noble, long running battle over selling someone on being just another peon shaking his fist at the castle. \n\nDon't know if that helps.","created_utc":1528090962,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Ten months after she took office, a new regulation allowed the use of private emails only if federal records were \"preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system\".\n\n&gt; Mrs Clinton maintains that this requirement was satisfied because most of her emails from her personal account went to, or were forwarded to, people with government accounts, so they were automatically archived. Any other emails were turned over to State Department officials when they issued a request to her - and several of her predecessors - in October 2014.\n\n","created_utc":1528426808,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"FinusFiatus","body":"sure, gladly. this is a phenomenon that has repeated itself multiple times over the course of human history. first thing i'd say is grab some literature on the roman empire. i know that's not an answer, but i wanted to put it out there in case you haven't considered it before. for a period in history that took place so long ago, the similarities between the west and the roman empire will blow you away.  there's also a great [paper](http:\/\/people.uncw.edu\/kozloffm\/glubb.pdf) (much shorter) that you might find interesting. it covers the topic of mass migration within the broader topic of how empires come to be and how they fall apart. i'd say it's one of the key papers that nudged me off of my left-leaning views a couple years ago. at that time, i voted for the very prime minister who now celebrates discrimination against whites and males because he thinks that when social outcomes are not equal (e.g., blacks and whites are not arrested at the same rates per capita), then the dominant group (e.g., whites in this example) are the cause. this is a dangerous and divisive message to send while you are simultaneously inviting over 300,000 migrants in per year, which is now the case in canada.\n\nit is also worth considering that adolf hitler wanted to achieve racial homogeneity through exclusion (i.e., the aryan race), while justin trudeau and other western leaders (with the SINGLE exception of donald trump) appear to want to achieve racial homogeneity through inclusion. if neither mechanism is voluntary, then you would be hard pressed to convince me that one path is any less moral than the other because there is no freedom of association in either case. if you want to associate with whites only, then you should be allowed. blacks, hispanics and asians all the same. i'm sure that you've observed this tribalism taking place in the united states. when different races choose to live among each other in a neighborhood, then that pleases me just fine as well, provided that their association is voluntary. but let's look at a simpler example. let's say you run a company and the government tells you that you must now introduce diversity quotas. (this is emerging in the legal and engineering professions in parts of canada.) where's the freedom in that? hey, if you want to hire all whites or all mexicans, then i say go for it. but if your product sucks, then the free market will let you know pretty damn quickly. and maybe at that point, you should open up your mind a bit... but if diversity is such a great idea, then tell me... why is it mandatory? i love changing for the better at every opportunity i get. do you tell your child \"hey, i want you to become big and strong one day, but in order for you to get that way i'm going to have to beat you with a belt 5 times a week.\" no. to me, the voluntary element of diversification is key to achieving social cohesion. this is not attained through open borders. and in fact, the utopian goal of homogeneity through inclusion will result in the elimination of true diversity. in any case, homogeneity cannot take place without first overcoming the challenge of rising social tensions among groups that carry significantly different, deeply ingrained values and ethics.\n\nlastly, i would say that to really expand on my views on diversity, i would first need to know more about where you're coming from. there's a key question in all of this: do you think that racial differences are cultural (easily changed within a generation) or biological (evolved over tens of thousands of years of group separation)? i believe this question to be at the heart of the whole debate...","created_utc":1528760816,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Shutting down immigration and diversity is antithesis to what we were founded on and by.\n\nIn closing, I truly don't believe your prime minister \"celebrates discrimination against whites and males\", as that sounds exactly like some rage radio AM blather talking point made to divide and scare you.\n\nThe fact you don't realize how easy whites have had it compared to every other race is key here. The reason for some of this \"forced diversity\" as you put it, is to try to level out the playing field. Non-whites have been discriminated against in varying ways for centuries and have to work double or triple hard to get where most whites can fairly easily.\n\nSociety as a whole has been set up to foster white privilege while keeping non-whites down. Look up the red lines in big cities, where neighborhoods where segregated to keep blacks apart from whites, among other things. That's just one example though.\n\nThis is slowly changing, and the ways to promote diversity in fair way to all need to be looked at and modified until we get it right.

A couple of these I agree with that they are, in fact, flaws but they are no reason to throw away the entire study. Things like:\n1. Only including 52% of the work force\n2. Not having results the author expected or thinks plausible\n3. Not including results from some types of jobs\nwhile they are drawbacks, are not valid reasons to throw away the entire study. I would with #3 in that not covering all the bases would allow some data to slip through the cracks. If someone switched jobs from job a to job b, it would only show as them leaving job a since job b was not studied. However the inverse is true as well. If someone switched from job b to job a it would count as someone _unemployed_ joining job a. I agree that this is not the most ideal method, however it merely casts doubt. Hypothetically if, for some reason, the minimum wage increases caused a surge of people from job a to job b, then it would surely be problematic. However there is no reason to suspect that it would do that therefore simply creating suspicion really all that #3 does.\n\n4. Claims that its results are different from many other studies. Again this isn't evidence in and of itself, however it's worth being noted. It also shouls be noted that there's a plethora of studies in its favor. Science isn't just an arms race of studies, granting victory to whoever can dish them out the fastest. There's no real point to saying there are a lot of studies that disagree with the study, except to cast doubt\n\nThere's some noteworthy info in the linked article for sure but none of it strikes a critical blow to the integrity of the study.","created_utc":1528829464,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"CountryBeforeParty","body":"You're incredibly delusional and ignorant. You're comparing people like me to real extremists like Nazis and KKK. You're just about as fucking retarded are Reich-wingers, and I honestly wonder if you are one or at least a Russian troll. Just like Wilanator, you think you're being reasonable, but instead you're just being incredibly stupid and naive. You being a centrist doesn't make you \"all-knowing\" like you seem to think it does, it just makes you at least half as ignorant as republicans. You know absolutely nothing of what's going on with NK right now, and nothing but the image of it is positive. Peace talks with NK are necessary, but trump is the last person we want at those talks. \n\nYou must not have read a fucking word I said in my last comment or just ignored it because it contradicts your false narrative of what's really going on, which shows your ignorance and bigotry. He did nothing to bring peace and denuclearization to the Korean peninsula, but only sought to admire his dictatorship rule and try selling him real estate opportunities. He didn't practice for the meeting one fucking bit, because he thought he could just wing it and let his business \"skills\" do the talking, which is essentially what he did. If you think trump is doing any good by stroking his own ego along with Kim's, you're incredibly delusional. The only thing historic about this was how historically stupid it was. On top of all this, he's pissing off our allies who probably hate us by now and at the same time praising murderous dictators like Kim Jong-Un and Vladimir Putin.\n\nI used to be a centrist and think I was so much smarter than everyone else by bringing up points from both sides and giving both a chance. Years and years of witnessing and experiencing exponentially increased hatred from the right has pushed me further and further left. Now only idiots like you and Wilanator remain in the middle, because idiots like you are willfully ignorant to the hatred of the right. I still share traits with conservatives, but that doesn't mean I support them knowing that it will only help further their own agenda in doing so, but that *is* what you're doing. I will even agree with conservatives on certain issues still, assuming they are right, but even then, I know openly agreeing with them only helps to further their agenda, so I keep it to myself.\n\nBut why do I even bother? Idiots like you are just as delusional in your centrism as republicans are bigoted and hateful. If you're dumb enough to compare my unwillingness to tolerate intolerance to actual extremism like that of Nazis and KKK, then you're too dumb to listen to reason. If you wanna cry about it, just remember you brought this on yourself.","created_utc":1528904421,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.\n\n    President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n    Convinced that the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognizing that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following:\n\n    1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.\n\n    2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n    3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n    4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW\/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.\n\n    Having acknowledged that the U.S.-DPRK summit \u2014 the first in history \u2014 was an epochal event of great significance in overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening up of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un commit to implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously. The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-up negotiations, led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the U.S.-DPRK summit.\n\n    President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea have committed to cooperate for the development of new U.S.-DPRK relations and for the promotion of peace, prosperity, and security of the Korean Peninsula and of the world.\n\n    (Signed)\n\n    DONALD J.

{"author":"LabTech41","body":"So, what exactly is Trump supposed to do?  Let's break it down:\n\n1 - He can do nothing about NK, in which case he'd be in fine company alongside every President since the operational end of the Korean War.  Hasn't helped the US because we have to keep soldiers at the DMZ with the world's biggest minefield between us (this being the reason that the US was one of the few nations NOT to sign the anti-landmine treaty years ago), and it hasn't helped the Korean people because it keeps them split as a people with an existential crisis hanging over their heads.\n\n2 - He can resume the war and attempt to change things through conflict, in which case (assuming you'd even get the authorization) you're looking at a catastrophic war in the Korean peninsula which almost certainly will spread throughout the subcontinent.  Obviously bad for BOTH sides.  I don't think anyone outside the MI Complex would have a hard-on for this option.\n\n3 - He can attempt to do the seemingly impossible, and attempt to resolve the matter through diplomatic negotiation; in which case no matter HOW reprehensible Un is, you HAVE to go through him for that process to happen.  As a dictator, it's not like someone can go around him in the legislative process.  If NK was ruled by a nice person who was known for humanitarian actions, we wouldn't be in this situation to begin with.\n\nI get it, really, I get it:  Trump can't do any right, and every action he makes has to be seen in the worst possible light, I hear what you're saying.  Most days I'd even agree with you, but in this particular scenario, where Trump's in a position to check off one of the Big Ticket foreign policy challenges of the modern era potentially, he's only got a couple options, and the best option forces him to begrudgingly deal with a certifiable monster.  This doesn't mean that Trump is a monster, not until he personally executes a guy with an anti-aircraft gun and causes mass-starvation.  The hyperbole makes for good press, but bad discussions.\n\nAnd no, I didn't vote for or support Trump; I voted for Sanders in the primary, so don't make like I'm gaslighting.","created_utc":1529034397,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"iwascompromised","body":"Hitler said it about Jews.\n\n&gt;All this was inspired by the principle - which is quite true in itself - that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes. From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited. Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, where as in reality they are a race? And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true. Schopenhauer called the Jew \"The Great Master of Lies\". Those who do not realize the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in helping Truth to prevail.\n\n&gt;Mein Kampf, 1925 [source\n](https:\/\/www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org\/hitler-on-the-big-lie)&gt; \n\nJoseph Goebbles wrote an article titled \"Churchill's Lie Factory\" in 1941 accusing the British of using this method.\n\n&gt;The essential English leadership secret does not depend on particular intelligence. Rather, it depends on a remarkably stupid thick-headedness. The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.\n\n&gt;[Joseph Goebbles, January 12 1941](http:\/\/research.calvin.edu\/german-propaganda-archive\/goeb29.htm)\n\nGermany and the Nazi Party did use similar methods, but it certainly didn't come from them alone.\n\nBut, much more interestingly is the US Office of Strategic Services psychological profile of Hitler. It's much more accurate in describing Trump as well.\n\n&gt;He is a master of the art of propaganda. Ludecke writes:\n\n &gt;&gt;   \"He has a matchless instinct for taking advantage of every breeze to raise a political whirlwind. No official scandal was so petty that he could not magnify it into high treason; he could ferret out the most deviously [unreadable] corruption in high places and plaster the town with the bad news.\" (159) \n\n&gt;His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.\n\n&gt;[Source](http:\/\/www.nizkor.org\/hweb\/people\/h\/hitler-adolf\/oss-papers\/text\/oss-profile-03-02.html)","created_utc":1529428942,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Just using ANY mainstream form of news, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, etc is a poor idea. They are biased, very biased. This last election exposed it completely.

An example, the 2004 lapse on the ban of assault rifle because of the NRA has led to the bloodiest gang violence in Mexico because all these newly minted and legal firearms are being sent to Mexico's drug-lords.

{"author":"ting_bu_dong","body":"I think Peter Zeihan lays out a pretty good argument for why the US doesn't really care about the rest of the world anymore.\n\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/215078563\n\nTLDR:  Free trade was only ever a strategic tool to bribe an alliance to help us fight the Cold War.  We don't need the alliance anymore.  We've been moving away from this model for some time.\n\nBut the rest of the world still depends on it.\n\nI think he's got it right.  Even from the start, GATT was seen as a bad deal for the US by its chief economic negotiator.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.wto.org\/english\/tratop_e\/gatt_e\/stalin_marshall_conclude_negotiations_e.htm\n\n&gt;In 1947, the \"Truman doctrine\" was developed as a countermeasure to the Soviet Union's growing influence and with a view to containing communism. A key part of this doctrine was European Recovery Program, which would assist in the reconstruction of all European countries willing to participate.  The program eventually became known as the Marshall Plan, in honor of General George C. Marshall, who at the time served as US Secretary of State.  Both Clayton and Lovett reported to him. . \n\n&gt;These major political events not only impacted on the GATT negotiations but, in fact were determinative of their outcome.  When considering Clayton's proposal to walk away from the negotiations with the United Kingdom, the Department of State was keenly aware that the Soviets had been closely monitoring the discussions, and seemed ready to fully exploit the emerging disagreement to their advantage. A collapse of the GATT negotiations would have been disastrous to the US foreign policy plans and weakened one of its most important strategic relationships. \n\nWe just happen to have a president now whose favorite pastime is telling others how he doesn't need anyone else, and that they can go fly a kite.  He's an asshole.  But, well, he kinda can get away with it.\n\nEdit :  I see that people disagree... Is this not an accurate take on it?\n\nPut briefly:\n\nhttp:\/\/zeihan.com\/this-is-how-the-world-ends-part-iii\/\n\n&gt;As in Europe, local media in China is all aghast with how unreasonable the Americans are being. As in Europe, the real decisionmakers are being far more circumspect. President Xi has been deathly quiet. He and the politburo may have nationalist aspirations, but they fully realize the reality of global power ratios.\n\n[...] \n\n&gt;Since World War II the Americans have used that imbalance to create a unified global system. Should that commitment fail \u2013 and it is \u2013 anyone dependent upon global trade is more or less screwed.\n\n[...]\n\n&gt;European bureaucrats don\u2019t get that. American media doesn\u2019t get that. But Merkel does. So does Xi. He has to.

{"author":"derangeddollop","body":"&gt;The lessons of Obama\u2019s immigration legacy\u2014and of his legislative legacy in general\u2014were clear to many liberals at the time, but have come into greater focus in the Trump era. And one of the principal lessons is this: It is a mistake to cause harm as a dangle for bipartisan support. **Democrats today, and in any future majority, would do better to accept the nature of the opposition, and try to help as many people as possible, as much as possible, in any particular political moment.**\n\n...\n\n&gt;This same lesson applies elsewhere in the realm of domestic policy. Democrats wasted most of a year in 2009 trying to entice Republicans to support health-care reform. They conceded substantive ideas they liked, and adopted Republican ideas, without realizing Republicans were stringing them along, and when the process was over, zero Republicans voted for the health care bill they had helped to weaken, and they called it \u201csocialism\u201d anyhow. One of the consequences of this error was higher premiums and deductibles, which harmed actual people, some of whom surely punished Democrats in 2016 by staying home, or voting for Trump, who turned around and sabotaged the Affordable Care Act.  \n**Democrats can upend this vicious cycle.** It\u2019s important for people who care about the truth to rebut these lies, but **Democrats can\u2019t count on people who don\u2019t care about truth to be deterred by fact-checking. All they can do is refuse to reward liars\u2014accept what they\u2019re up against, and do as much good as they have the power to do whenever they can**.","created_utc":1529785262,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The supposed high priests of Libmerica, FDR and LBJ, weren\u2019t interested in folks\u2019 guns. Obama, when he had both houses, didn\u2019t take all the guns, despite that being the hue-and-cry for eight years. \nIt\u2019s like this guy who keeps announcing the day he discovered the world will end, and when we\u2019re all still alive he suddenly discovers his math error and comes up with the new day, until which time we should all do his bidding and support him financially so we can be in good with the Lord.\n\nEven if a liberal president were actually serious, it still wouldn\u2019t happen. Like, does anyone actually think that if Bernie were president now, there\u2019d ACTUALLY be free health care and free college for everyone right now, or in our immediate future...? Hell no. That was a pipe dream. \nIf Trump and Pence woke up tomorrow and decided to decree that the Bible is now the law of the land, and people are going to be pledging allegiance to the president instead of the flag, it wouldn\u2019t actually happen.\nThat too is pipe dream, alternate-universe type stuff.\nNo one is taking the guns. I live in Texas too, so I\u2019m not making fun of you. But it\u2019s not real. \n\nNow, if we interpret the amendment literally, Bible-style, then \u2018shall not be infringed\u2019 means a ton of shit we ALL agree we don\u2019t want.\n\nWe could not legally prevent three year olds from bringing pistols to school if their parents don\u2019t care. Hey, he\u2019s a citizen. He doesn\u2019t magically become a citizen at eighteen. His right shall not be infringed. He gets to come heavy to recess.\nWe could not legally prevent people currently serving a prison term or committed to a \u2018nuthouse\u2019 from ordering a weapon and having it delivered TO the prison\/asylum. Hey, he didn\u2019t lose his citizenship when we convicted him of rape or institutionalized him for threatening to kill the people he sees all around him who are really alien reptiles underneath. Shall not be infringed, says so right here. He just has it in his cell; he hasn\u2019t used it yet, and he has the uninfringeable right to bear it, so our hands are tied. \n\nHeck, \u2018bear arms\u2019 encompasses a lot of things. \u2018Arms\u2019 is not just firearms. Am I entitled to biological weapons, dirty bombs, nuclear warheads, if I have a source and the cash? Well, it SAYS my right to bear \u2018arms\u2019 is airtight.\n\nSo I mean, I would expect normal conservatives to agree that the amendment CANNOT allow all these things, so it cannot literally mean \u2018shall not be infringed\u2019.

That is why I haven't attacked your positions outright, because I believe there are roots to the thought process, although I'd argue flawed, that lead you to your current assertions.\n\nSo, thank you for being honest with my answer and I shall continue to do the same...\n\nI can understand that you're not religious. You're right, you've made it quite well known that religion isn't your cup of tea. Therefore, I have to wonder, do you understand the cake shop owner's dilemma? On one hand, he doesn't want to be a dick to his patrons, the people who keep him in business, and on the other he has deeply held religious views on the celebration of homosexual unions. \n\nAs the adage goes, \"God, Country, Family.\" For him and many other religious people, God comes before all else. That is why we have the 1st amendment, so that the government can't tell you how to practice, and he can't force you to practice a certain way through the government. It wasn't the act of selling cakes to homosexuals he objected to, it was partaking in the celebration of something he believed to be sinful. Those are his views, and thankfully not the governments. It would be tyrannical for the government to cause you to do something against your own religious conscience. In the same breath, it is unlawful to discriminate against someone for something that isn't their own fault (age, race, sex, etc).\n\nYes, there are limitations on that- and those limitations are very much stemmed from impeding on other people's Natural Rights. The right to patronage is not a Natural Right. We also have the Freedom of Association. The government cannot tell us who we can and cannot associate with. Therefore, although he may discriminate what services he provides under any given circumstance, he cannot (and wouldn't) outright deny people just because of their skin or lawful lifestyle.\n\nSo while we are talking in terms of Christianity, we have to expand the the argument to the most extremes: What if your religion was to kill people every Wednesday? Well, that would impede on other individual's Natural Rights. That's a no-go. What if your religion was to pray 5 times a day? OK, knock yourself out. What if your religion was to pray 5 times a day, stopping what you were doing, causing you to impede highway traffic.

{"author":"toweldayeveryday","body":"This isn't whataboutism though, this is pointing out hypocrisy.\n\nMaxine Waters tweeted approvingly of a private business owner's decision to - politely and respectfully - ask Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave said business.  She also encouraged others to continue to confront members of the Trump administration in public about administration policies. In no way did she advocate or call for violence.\n\nThe reason the above is relevant is that Trump and many right-wing pundits have not only mischaracterized her remarks as a call for violence - some outright lying, others only spinning -  but have also responded in a way that really looks like incitement to violence *against Maxine Waters in particular*.\n\nDemonstrating that Trump is not only doing this in bad faith, but is also guilty of the very things he and his allies are feigning outrage about is not whataboutism. It is revealing the exact sort of projection that has become a mainstay of right wing media for years. \n\nIt also demonstrates what I feel is a fundamental point of disagreement between us, regardless of whether either of us is correct  in regards to this being whataboutism: This issue is not about convincing the Trump supporters, reconciling with them or being more civil to them. It's not about whether or not what Maxine Waters advocated was a good strategy, a good idea, taking the high road or the low, or any of the other takes on this I've seen here or anywhere else on the internet. It's about pointing out that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nI don't care what the hardcore Trump supporters think of Rep Waters. I ***do*** care that the third party voters, independent voters, undecided voters, and non-voters from 2016 see that Trump is morally and ethically bankrupt. That he is fundamentally dishonest, acting in bad faith, and is fundamentally unfit to lead so much as a fast food franchise, much less the entire country.","created_utc":1530054431,"score":17,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Although democrats will be at a big disadvantage in the legislative elections this year (for example because only a third of senate seats are up for election each time, and this year most of them are Democratic seats, so we must hold a lot and have few opportunities for flips), it is historically our \"time\" in the cycle when we should, supposedly, be more energized and eager to vote.\n\nIn addition, to answer your overall question of the thread, conservatives are insanely good at meming.

During the Obama era, family separation only occurred in the relatively rare cases when an entrant was referred for felony prosecution. This only occurred for second-time crossers who had previously been deported, and even then not all of them were immediately remanded. Asylum seekers who identified themselves as such weren\u2019t incarcerated at all. \n\nNow, a few things are very different under the Trump administration. First, we have all crossers being prosecuted, including first-timers and asylum seekers. Second, even though first-offense crossing is a misdemeanor and incarceration of misdemeanor suspects is not the norm in any other area of the American justice system, the Trump\/Sessions administration is incarcerating all of these misdemeanor suspects, apparently without even offering an option of bail. The fact that the separations are \u201conly\u201d incidental to incarceration isn\u2019t really relevant; the fact is that for the last few months the agency had been detaining all crossers and separating all families, whereas in the previous administration both detention and family separation were relatively rare events. \n\nSo on the one hand it is a question of magnitude or scope, in that this was a very small-scale if not simply rare event under Obama, and on the other hand it\u2019s a question of humanity in that the old policy was generally humane and the new policy is not.

(It really doesn't focus on the latter; the title is click bait-y.)\n\nBut you jumped a Hitler shark. When Hitler is in phase 2 of isolating dissenting parts of the population, it is not time for a sit-in. It is time for a fucking revolution.

Moderates who make up most of America. Moderates who will vote in ALL the elections. Local, state, and national. So when they have to ask, \"Is this immigrant thing being overblown?

Do I believe the \"liberal\" (for lack of a better word) viewpoint?\" And someone with the \"liberal\" viewpoint starts talking about how we are Hitler stage 2, and it really, really doesn't look like Hitler stage 2.

{"author":"cat_treatz","body":"&gt;There was nothing unconstitutional about Republicans denying Garland a hearing. The constitution is not explicit on the matter. It's time to get over that.\n\nPerhaps there is nothing in the *constitution* denying that, but there is a *legislative* precedent of over 200 years in age that McConnell threw out the window, covered in sewage, and set on fire by blocking Garland. I consider that abandonment of such a long and respected precedent to be a detonation of a nuclear option, and fully expect Dems to do the same in turn whenever possible from this point forward.\n\n&gt;The Supreme Court has been right leaning for the last 45 years. They've thrown liberals a few bones with some big decisions over the decades, Roe v Wade, gay marriage, upholding Obamacare etc\n\nPardon me, but I was under the impression that Supreme Court justices were supposed to rule based on the text of the law and the constitution, not their own political leanings. This attitude that by the GOP that it is a spoils system is 95% of the problem.\n\n&gt;The only constitutional solution to our current predicament is to win the House, Senate and Presidency in 2020, write a law increasing the size of the Supreme Court and pack it with at least 2 more liberal judges.\n\nThat might work in the short run, but do you have any doubt that the next time the GOP has the chance, they will just add an additional 2 on top of that? I'm not saying it is a bad idea, but to me it seems like a bandaid. Finding a solution that fixes the deeper problems is easier said than done, of course, and I don't have an easy answer to that. If I had to throw an idea out there, I would say that Justices should be first confirmed by the Senate to serve on an interim basis, and then confirmed as an up or down vote by the majority of American voters next time there is a general election (perhaps not midterms, as disenfranchisement means many people can't get off work to vote then) to see if they should become permanent, that would provide an incentive for the prez to pick either moderates or justices that can be trusted to be impartial (hah haha ha)","created_utc":1530198298,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

When AS died, congressional Republicans kept SCOTUS at 8 for over a year to see how the 2016 election played out to see if they could get someone better in, which is a gross abuse of power to hinder an entire branch for a year, apparently for solely partisan reasons. With DT elected a more conservative justice was appointed. With Kennedy leaving, it opens up the possibility for a strongly conservative SCOTUS for decades, since appointment is for life. I don\u2019t think it should be blocked for blocking sake, but Congress should be holding out for a centrist judge so that the court can remain less politically biased. The concern is that MAJOR changes could ensue and significantly impact the lives of millions of Americans (e.g. R v Wade).

Since taking office he has wrecked our relationships with our foreign allies while sucking up to dictators, passed extreme tariffs which are reversing our previous economic growth, and commuted truly despicable acts like separating children from their parents.  Him and his supporters deserve what they get, instead of making America great they are making us the backwards, laughing-stock of the world.  \n\nAs for history, America has never been as perfect as you hyper-nationalists think it was.  Instead of accepting though that we have always done the best we could and sometimes failed in the process, you are now seeking to rewrite history into an image you find more palatable.  The biggest way I see this is with the veneration of the Confederacy in the South.  It doesn't matter if they were fighting to preserve slavery (the single, most horrifying blemish on American history), people still continue to fly their flag and raise monuments to their soldiers because they would rather redefine their fight than accept their ancestors were racist.

Any significant Gun laws are going to be a massive issue to even attempt to enforce since so many people possess them. The Internet makes a black market nearly impossible to stop the circulation of guns from Getting into the hands of the wrong people. \n\nWhile I am all in favor of doing what we can in terms of keeping guns out of the hands of the wrong people, people need to realize that most of these mass shootings aren\u2019t carried out by the thug whose got a criminal record as long as a CVS receipt. They are carried out by the \u201c I could never see him doing that\u201d type of guy. \n\nThe most effective, cheapest, and easiest to implement solution is to increase our defense at schools, workplaces, and public places. \n\nI agree it\u2019s impossible to come up with a perfect solution that keeps us 100% protected.

And since you can't separate people from their views, standing by them *does* mean standing by their views.\n\n&gt; That does not mean standing by their views. This person DID NOT say that, and you continuing to thunder and moan about reprehensible opinions continues to be irrelevant to what the actual discussion was. They seem to be arguing, and they\u2019re welcome to chime in, that we don\u2019t support their opinions, but that defending their human rights and acknowledging they are human beings is separate from what they think about x. AKA \u2018standing by them as brothers and sisters\u2019. That\u2019s what this person is recommending, and here\u2019s you claiming we shouldn\u2019t.\n\nNo, it isn't. It's not \"thundering and moaning\" to not want anything to do with someone because of their reprehensible opinions. There is no standing together with someone who has reprehensible views. I can stand by someone who merely disagrees because by doing so, I'm not cosigning any sentiments I find abhorrent. You can't separate someone from their views, so it is absolutely relevant that I include them in this discussion. \n\nIt is perfectly relevant to point out someone's views as reprehensible when they ask for \"peace and love.\" It's also relevant when someone says they don't want to be called Nazi, bigot etc and they still \"love me\" and are asking for that in return, because those views are why they can't have peace and love from me, and won't get me to stop calling them Nazis and bigots, both of which are components of \"standing together.\" Even only children realize not wanting to violate the human rights of reprehensible people isn't the same as standing with them as \"brothers and sisters.\" It's breathtaking how fucking stupid you are.\n\n&gt;Yeah, I guess we\u2019re going to be disagreeing about whether or not that\u2019s the right thing to do. You keep specifically saying, using your exact words, that they are \u2018unworthy of having decent people stand by them\u2019. You are saying, in arguing that you refuse to lift a finger for someone whose views you reject.\n\nI'm under no obligation to lift a finger for someone I find abhorrent. They are not my brothers and sisters, and I wouldn't go out of my way to help them, and they are not entitled to civility.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s your right, we all just appear to disagree that that\u2019s the ethical high road. Please. The meat of the problem the last couple years is people like YOU. You are spouting things that make you sound like just as much a jackboot as the Trumpers. The problem nowadays is \u2018you don\u2019t agree with me and I judge your opinions vile, therefore not only are you not worth TALKING to, civility is unnecessary when interacting with you\u2019. The next step from there is not caring if they get hurt. Then you hope they do. From there it\u2019s not too far to being the one to do it.\n\nNo, the problem of the last few years are terrible people who say and believe terrible things and have made civic discourse nearly impossible, and the people who enable them, like **you.**\n\nThere's no place in public discourse for people who believe it'sokay for police to shoot people for being black and that brown asylum seekers and immigrants should have their children taken from them and locked in cages. Pretending there is only allows people who believe those terrible things to feel validation. You are saying I have to call people my \"brothers and sisters\" who are literal Nazis, and that is by no means an obligation of mine. \n\n&gt;They are \u2018unworthy of having decent people stand by them\u2019. So when Julie is standing on the corner shouting about abortion doctors rotting in hell and women who have abortions being disgusting murderers, when she gets hit by a bus on her way back to her car, or shot in a drive-by, or gets pulled into an alley by a couple of guys who are going to rape and strangle her, she is, by your own words, \u2018unworthy\u2019 of our acknowledgement that she is a human being and....uh, you know, helping her out. You\u2019ve already stated there is no compromise; it doesn\u2019t exist. So how are you not implying that the end logic is that if something happens to her, even if we didn\u2019t proactively cause it, we cannot but be better off without her, given that certain of her statements proved her vile and unworthy?\n\nWhat is this nonsense? Terrible people are entitled to their legal rights. Do you have any clue what you're talking about, or do you just make inane hypotheticals? I don't have to \"stand by Julie\" to acknowledge legal rights and even not want something as terrible as what you describe to happen. Standing by someone would encompass far more than that. I can be against terrible things happening to a person while not calling them my \"brother or sister\" and believing their views are intolerable and deserve no acknowledgement in civil discourse, or that there should be social consequences. Of course, I don't even believe someone like in your example would even be deserving of that because as warped as that view is, it's not as abhorrent as say thinking migrant children should be taken from their parents, and her actions aren't as bad as grabbing a woman by the pussy. Your hypothetical is bad, and you should feel bad.\n\n&gt;Her views have rendered her \u2018unworthy\u2019 of your support. So sure, keep walking. Her \u2018views are so vile and disgusting that they make the people espousing them unworthy\u2019, and \u2018civility with the indecent is a pointless exercise\u2019.\n\nOkay. Going to come down off your ridiculous soapbox now?\n\n&gt;Hey, you said it yourself. No whining about \u2018I\u2019ve been taken out of context\/that\u2019s not what I meant at all and no one would think it was\u2019. I used \u2018disingenuous\u2019 purposely; you just disagree, that\u2019s all. You\u2019re welcome to disagree. But if you know what the word \u2018unworthy\u2019 means, using it in the context you did suggests you don\u2019t know the difference between two other words you used: \u2018decent\u2019 and \u2018indecent\u2019.\n\nIt isn't whining to point out you have no clue what neither you nor I are talking about. At this point, you're just inanely rambling to feel like you've won something.\n\n&gt;Those are your words. There are lots of people like you, on both sides, wishing folks on the other side into a flaming oven because their views render them unworthy. You\u2019re welcome to your unrealistic, unreasonable hostility.\n\nWhich it doesn't seem like you understand. My words weren't anyone should be raped and killed.\n\n&gt;But the point the rest of us are making is that people shouting this hateful stuff are still PEOPLE, and you, fortunately, aren\u2019t an emperor and don\u2019t get to tell the rest of us where we can and can\u2019t spend our civility and who is or is not \u2018worthy\u2019.\n\nAnd neither are you fortunately, because you'd be an even crazy emperor than Caligula.\n\n&gt;Your self-righteous resentment doesn\u2019t make you correct, and it DEFINITELY doesn\u2019t put you in the \u2018decent\u2019 group you seem positive to be in. Fake it till you make it, though. It works for your ironic spirit animal The Donald. Well, cheers.\n\nYou using the term self-righteous makes you as disingenuous and as much of a projector as The Donald. I haven't seen such a \"holier-than-thou\" rant lacking lucidity at some time. But I'm hardly surprised. Terms and words you don't understand are of course your favorite to use.\n\nYou're a lying, entitled, narcissistic, piece of shit with a delusional sense of self-importance that borders on a messiah complex. You've been making up sentiments I've never had to attribute to me, building strawmen, moving goal posts, and otherwise intentionally misunderstanding what I actually have said. Good luck.

{"author":"Motherdiedtoday","body":"Where do you get your information from? Sounds like you've been fed a load of horseshit. Here are some facts.\n\nConservatives are actually losing a lot of electoral ground. This is largely attributable to the deep unpopularity of Donald Trump, even among life-long conservative Republicans. Notice how the Republican party has shrunk quite a bit in the past 18 months? \n\nIn 2017, states conducted 98 special elections for legislative seats, ranging from a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama to state House races in New Hampshire. Democrats flipped 16 of those seats \u2014 including the race in Alabama, where Doug Jones became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in a generation. Republicans won only three formerly Democratic-held seats, in Louisiana, Mississippi and Massachusetts. \n\nRepublicans haven't fared better in 2018.\n\nDemocrats support open borders? Again, sounds like you've been fed a load of horseshit. Sure they might be some fringe \"Democrats\" who have voiced support for this idea. But let's remember that the Republicans have an actual Holocaust-denying Nazi running for the House of Representatives in Illinois? So can we say that Republicans are Holocaust denying Nazis? No? Why? Because that wouldn't be a fair and accurate representation of Republicans views? \n\nDemocrats DO NOT support open borders. This assertion has no basis in fact. \n\nGovernment healthcare, very unpopular? Again, horseshit. EVERY reputable poll shows that a majority of Americans support the establishment of a federally funded single-payer healthcare system.\n\nTaxes? Again, Horseshit. Most American's view Trump's tax cuts unfavorably. \n\nCalling white people racist every time they disagree with you? Does this REALLY happen? Sounds made up to me. Are you denying that there is racism in this country though? Sounds like you're a little defensive here.\n\nUnhinged and constant attacks on Trump and his supporters? What do you mean by \"unhinged\"? Probably people just joking around, just like Trump is joking when he calls Mexican \"rapists?\" or when he calls for shutting down the free press, right? Yep, just jokes. Harassment and verbal attacks? How about driving a car through a group of protestors? How about calling for vigilantes to gun down journalists? Death threats on elected officials? Shooting up black churches? Are you cool with all that?\n\nNational debt? Donald Trump promised to eliminate the debt in eight years. Instead, he will add $5.6 trillion, raising it to $25 trillion. Cool with that?\n\nSaying negative things about America? No president in history has done more to diminish America's stature in the eyes of the world that Donald Trump. \n\nI'm not trying to say you should have supported Obama or his policies. But you need to recognize how ridiculous you sound talking about other people being \"disconnected from reality\" when you've gotten so much wrong. \n\nReality is not partisan. If you want to be in touch with reality, you need to be able to think critically, and not simply swallow the loads of horseshit that are being shoveled our way each and every day.","created_utc":1530369432,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Its extreme\u00a0nationalism\u00a0came from\u00a0Pan-Germanism\u00a0and the\u00a0V\u00f6lkisch movementprominent in the\u00a0German nationalism\u00a0of the time, and it was strongly influenced by the\u00a0anti-Communist\u00a0Freikorps\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in\u00a0World War I, from which came the party's \"cult of violence\" which was \"at the heart of the movement.\"[2]\nNazism subscribed to theories of\u00a0racial hierarchy\u00a0and\u00a0Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an\u00a0Aryan\u00a0or\u00a0Nordic\u00a0master race.[3]It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of\u00a0Lebensraum\u00a0and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or \"inferior\" races.\nThe term \"National Socialism\" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of \"socialism\", as an alternative to both\u00a0international socialism\u00a0and\u00a0free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the\u00a0Marxistconcept of\u00a0class conflict, opposed\u00a0cosmopolitan\u00a0internationalism\u00a0and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the \"common good\", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization.[4]\n","created_utc":1530371822,"score":-5,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The democrats were seeking to overcome a Republican Congress that explicitly said it refused to work with them, while the current Congress is using it to overcome the Democrats without needing to work with them or take input from them and try to make bi-partisan agreements. I wish the two parties got along, but the current political field incentivizes candidates who refuse to compromise. I am liberal, but some conservative policies aren\u2019t terrible either, especially in smaller rural areas where economic conservatism is a better choice. But neither side should have to find ways to force their choices through with only partisan votes in fields as big as the Supreme Court.
